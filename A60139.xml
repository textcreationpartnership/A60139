            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHatever is likely to awaken Men to the Conſideration of the great acknowledged <hi>Principles of Religion,</hi> cannot be Unſeaſonable. And when 'tis every Man's Concern, the <hi>Meaneſt,</hi> and Weakeſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may be of <hi>ſome</hi> Uſe. The <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the following <hi>Reflections</hi> are moſt of them of that kind, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be attended to, by all ſorts of Perſons; and ſo cannot be too often preſt, though in different Manners.</p>
            <p>The uſefulneſs of the ſubject <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the ſmallneſs of the <hi>Bulk,</hi> are two Things which are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb facs="tcp:35082:3"/>a Book to moſt Readers: For which Reaſon, I may hope, this will be read by ſeveral, who ſuffer much better (becauſe bigger) Books to lye by them neglected. Some may poſſibly give it the Reading, as a <hi>New-Years-Gift.</hi> And whoever ſhall be ſo far perſwaded by it, as to ſet apart ſome Time in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Year, for <hi>Self-Examination, Confeſſion of Sin, Repentance, Thankſgiving,</hi> and ſolemn renewal <hi>of their Covenant with God,</hi> (which ſeveral of theſe Reflections may not only <hi>excite</hi> to, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to direct and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him in,) I am perſwaded he will thank me for putting him in Mind (at leaſt) of ſo <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> an Exerciſe. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of theſe Meditations were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb facs="tcp:35082:3"/>on a <hi>New-years day,</hi> tho' ſome <hi>others</hi> are thought fit to be inſerted, as tending to promote the ſame deſign. But knowing how much <hi>eaſier</hi> it is to ſtir up <hi>other Mens</hi> Devotion, than to command and keep alive <hi>my own;</hi> 'tis deſired, that the moſt Devout Thoughts contained in theſe Papers, may be looked upon as what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aims at, and would perſwade to, rather than what he hath already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: As what he knows he <hi>ought to be, and do,</hi> and doth ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, rather than what <hi>he is,</hi> and <hi>hath been;</hi> heartily lamenting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath been faulty, or defective in ſuch <hi>duties,</hi> as theſe, and the like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, do oblige to, and enforce upon <hi>All,</hi> who ſhall read them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more upon himſelf.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:35082:4"/>
            <p>That they were Penn'd at <hi>ſeveral times,</hi> and in occaſional Retirements for Spiritual Exerciſes, will, with the difference of the Subjects, be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Excuſe, that ſome are <hi>larger</hi> and others <hi>ſhorter,</hi> and that the <hi>Style</hi> is in ſome places more <hi>neglected</hi> than in others. If I may hereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>any Service</hi> to the Souls of Men, if any ſecure Sinner, any Self-deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hypocrite be hereby awakened, or any ſerious <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s <hi>Devotion</hi> be quickned and advanced, I hope God will accept it. To his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Recommend it, for thoſe Ends.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35082:5"/>their <hi>Beginning,</hi> ſo they have their <hi>End:</hi> And that the Diſtance, or Space of Time between the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> is very little. Let me not then, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Rejoyce and pleaſe my ſelf too much in <hi>New</hi> Injoyments, remembring a Change may be at hand, and the End is certain.</p>
               <p>Many who were <hi>Rich</hi> and Flouriſhing the <hi>laſt</hi> Year, may be reduced to <hi>Poverty</hi> and deep Diſtreſs, before the end of <hi>this:</hi> Who are now in a Capacity to relieve others, within a few Months, or a ſhorter Space, may be Objects of other Mens Charity. <hi>The Thing which hath been, is that which may be:</hi> And that which hath been ſeen in one Year, may happen in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo eaſily, ſo quickly may a <hi>Charge</hi> be made! Riches may unexpectedly change their Owners, and borrow wings of a thouſand Accidents, wherewith to fly to Heaven for a new Diſpoſal.
<note n="(*)" place="bottom">1 Cor. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>They therefore who poſſeſs, ſhould be as if they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed not; for the Faſhion of this World paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away.</hi> Innumerable Caſualties may effect that Change, which no Humane Art or Skill can poſſibly foreſee, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Afflictive unexpected Evils attend us every where: We cannot promiſe our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35082:5"/>ſelves Tranquility for a <hi>Day,</hi> much leſs <hi>one Year</hi> to come. They lay in wait for us on every ſide, enter at every Crevice, and commonly overtake us, when we are leaſt apprehenſive of their Approach.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 9.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Man that is born of a Woman is of few Days, and full of Trouble:</hi> He cometh up as a <hi>Flower,</hi> and is cut down; fleeth as a <hi>Shadow</hi> and continueth not. What then are Riches, Beauty, Strength and Honour, the Accidents of this <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which is it ſelf but a <hi>Shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How falſe is the Hope of Man, and how frail is all his Glory! One Day can make an End of all his Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: And yet what Solicitude, Care and Labour, to <hi>get</hi> what we deſire of theſe things, (though often we do not need 'em) and then to <hi>keep</hi> what we have gotten, and then to <hi>encreaſe</hi> it, and then to <hi>defend</hi> it, and at laſt to <hi>enjoy</hi> it, and in a Moment it is ſnatcht from us, or we from it. His <hi>Life</hi> is but a <hi>Vapour,</hi> on which they all depend; then how much leſs are they? To how ſpeedy an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are they ſubject! What numberleſs Inſtances of this, doth <hi>one Years Experience</hi> furniſh! what ſadning Diſappointments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35082:6"/>and unexpected Calamities have befallen many ſince this Day Twelve-month! and Multitudes who are now at Eaſe, and think their Mountains too ſtrong to be removed, ſhall meet with ſharper Tryals before the End of this Year. <hi>Alas!</hi> how few conſider or believe it, 'till they find it ſo? All Men ſhould count upon Trouble and Diſappointment, Suffering and Sorrow in this World; and he that hath the leaſt Share, is reckoned the moſt proſperous Man; and yet he knows not how ſoon his Portion may be doubled. We reckon our <hi>Joys</hi> by the Abſence of ſome degrees of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and Calamity that others meet with; and before the End of this Year, our Condition may be as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate as theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Though I know this to be true; though I cannot, I dare not deny it; yet how difficult is it to conquer the Love of this World, and of this Body, to that degree I ought! to undervalue the intereſt of a ſhort, a mutable, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and troubleſom <hi>Life,</hi> in compariſon of the permanent poſſeſſion of an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good! Though I know, that what is earthly and temporal muſt needs be thus changeable and fading; and that it is as true of <hi>Man</hi> himſelf, as of any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35082:6"/>the Sun; yet how do I forget <hi>what Man is!</hi> not only mutable in his <hi>State,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and his <hi>Life,</hi> but in his <hi>Mind</hi> too, ſo as to love and hate, to chuſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, to delight in, and abhor, ſuch things at one time, as he did not before. He doth not paſs the ſame <hi>Judgment,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame <hi>Affections</hi> at one time, as at another. How do I live, as if all this were as certainly falſe, as it is unqueſtionably true? admire, love, fear, truſt in <hi>Man,</hi> as if he were the direct <hi>Contrary</hi> to what he <hi>is,</hi> and ſeek for <hi>Immortality</hi> upon Earth, and act as if I were aſſured of it, and were not liable to any <hi>Change;</hi> though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and know the Contrary. Though the <hi>laſt Years Experience,</hi> and the obſervation of every Day, doth convince me of it; though all Hiſtory, and all the Records of the Grave atteſt it; though all Mankind in every Age have found it ſo; though it be a manifeſt notorious Truth, legible in the various Changes and Calamities, but eſpecially in the Duſt and Aſhes of all, who have lived before us, (our Graves being often made of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Duſt, and the Earth we bury in having once been living) yet how little is it believed, how ſeldom conſidered! The Confirmation of it which <hi>one Year</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35082:7"/>gives us, hath little Influence on our Hearts or Lives, with reſpect to the <hi>next.</hi> We ought therefore to <hi>accuſtom</hi> our ſelves to theſe Thoughts, before ſuch <hi>Changes</hi> happen, to which our <hi>Final Change</hi> ſhall e're long ſucceed.

We <hi>cenſure</hi> and condem <hi>Others,</hi> who are in an higher Station, and are called to more difficult work than we; when by a little Advancement, and the like Temptation, we diſcover that we are <hi>as bad</hi> as they.

               <p>Such a change, for Inſtance, as from <hi>Poverty</hi> to <hi>Riches,</hi> from <hi>Sickneſs</hi> to <hi>Health,</hi> from <hi>Obſcurity</hi> to <hi>Honour,</hi> from <hi>Privacy</hi> to a <hi>Publick charge,</hi> &amp;c. or on the contrary.

               <p>How vain and faulty is an Ambition to be talkt of after we are dead, which will be but by very <hi>few,</hi> and that very <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,</hi> and but for a <hi>little while; There is no Remembrance of former things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be of things to come, with thoſe that ſhall come after,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.11.

For no <hi>Glaſs</hi> is more brittle, no <hi>Bubble</hi> more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, no <hi>Ice</hi> more diſſolving, no <hi>Flower</hi>

               <p>There is hardly any thing very <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> mutable and uncertain, but the Spirit of God in Scripture ſets forth the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> by; as if he would teach us by it, from the Light of every periſhing Object, which our Eyes behold, to reflect on our own Mortality. We ſleep every <hi>Night,</hi> in the outer Chambers of Death: And in ſome Diſeaſes <hi>Sleep,</hi> which is the <hi>image</hi> and Picture of <hi>Death,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, to give place to the <hi>Original,</hi> and make way for death. And every year, every week, every day are we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to our final <hi>Change;</hi> which may overtake us e're we are aware. Every day we loſe ſome part of our Lives; in our very <hi>growth</hi> from Infancy to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, our Life decreaſes, and grows leſs. Every Pulſe and Breath doth tell us, we are haſtening to the End of Time, and calls upon us to diſpatch our Work.</p>

If we conſider <hi>Eternity,</hi> into <hi>that</hi> Time never entred; <hi>Eternity</hi> is not an Everlaſting Flux of Time; but Time is a ſhort Parentheſis in a long Period; and <hi>Eternity</hi> had been the ſame, as it is, tho' <hi>Time</hi> had never been.

               <p>Every <hi>Word</hi> we ſpeak, is formed of that Breath whereby we live; and we may not live to pronounce another Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but the Lamp of Life may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht and blown out by a ſudden Blaſt. Every thing we do, carries away ſome Sands of our little Glaſs of Time; and how little may remain? Or how ſoon may the Glaſs be broken? Our Souls are in our Bodies, as a little <hi>Air</hi> incloſed

Many have promiſed themſelves great things on the morrow, but dyed before Night: Let me not ſay, I ſhall not die <hi>this Day,</hi> when I may <hi>this Hour;</hi> and 'tis but <hi>once</hi> for all, there is no amending an ill Death, by another Tryal. <q>When I lie down to ſleep, I hope to riſe ſtronger and freſher, and fitter for work; but I know withal, I may riſe no more. And may not my Name be on the Roll of thoſe who ſhall <hi>next</hi> be called, at leaſt ſome time <hi>this Year?</hi> Let me not then neglect or fooliſhly delay my <hi>Principal Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to provide againſt a <hi>Change,</hi> which is inevitable, but the time of it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubtful. Ought not my firſt and chiefeſt care to be imployed, to make my peace with <hi>God,</hi> (He <hi>alone</hi> can be my happineſs to his final Judgment I am haſtening; His Favour <hi>alone</hi> can

               <p>IS the life of Man ſo ſhort and fleeting, our Days on Earth ſo few, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain? How careful ſhould I be to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage every Hour, endeavouring to match the <hi>Swiftneſs</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> by my celerity, and diligence to improve it? I can have no Buſineſs of greater or of equal Moment to mind, than to ſecure the Happineſs of my Soul in another World. And ſhall I laviſh my Time, and loſe my Pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things unneceſſary? What will all other Buſineſs ſignifie in the end, if this be neglected? Is there any Intereſt more weighty, that calleth me from ſuch work? Is there any thing elſe that ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my Time? That may be put into the Scales, or weighed in a balance a gainſt this? Shall <hi>Eternity,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all Time, have the leaſt ſhare of my Time allotted for its concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How little a part of my Time hath been hitherto employed in ſuch work! How reaſonable, how neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:35082:17"/>is it to redeem the little Inch of Time that yet remains, but haſtens to a Period? For as there is no Covenant to be made with Death, ſo no Agreement for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Stay of Time; it keeps its pace whether I redeem, and uſe it well or not.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of our Life is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly employed to avoid Death; we eat and drink, and ſleep, and labour, and reſt, that we may not die; and yet even by theſe we haſten to Death. Every Breath, every Pulſe, every Word leaves one leſs of the number, which God hath appointed me, and carries away ſome Sands of the Glaſs of <hi>Time;</hi> and yet how little care is taken to employ it well? We ſeldom value it, till we can no longer uſe it to any advantage; and though we know it can neither be retarded in its motion, or recalled when paſt, yet of nothing are we more prodigal. Yea, how many complain of it as a Burthen, and know not what to do with their Time, are exceedingly at a loſs wherein to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, what to do to be rid of it? But alas! how near is that Change, when they ſhall think nothing too dear to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſome few Grains of that Sand, which now ſeem too many, while they are paſſing through their Hour-glaſs?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35082:18"/>How ſad will be the review of our loſt and ill-ſpent Time? How different an Opinion of its Value ſhall we have on a Sick-Bed, or when our Time and Hope is gone? How many Weeks, and Days, and Hours, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> have I trifled away in Sloath and Idleneſs, in fooliſh Mirth, and hurtful Company, in vain Thoughts and impertinent Diſcourſe, in exceſs of Sleep, and needleſs Paſtimes, Feaſtings, inordinate Care to adorn the Body, or gratifie the ſenſual Appetite? All that which is paſt is irrecoverable; and the little remainder ſlies apace. How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will it be gone; how ſoon, how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, may an unexpected Stroke of Death conclude it? And yet this is all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I ſhall ever have, to make my Peace with God, and prepare for the everlaſting World.</p>
               <p>Did we conſider it as we ought, we ſhould not fooliſhly throw away ſo much of it in Trifles, and things impertinent, or what is worſe: How much more might we redeem than commonly we do? To how much better purpoſe might we hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it? How much more work might we do, were we never idle, or did not loyter? We might walk far, did we not often ſtand ſtill, or go out of our way.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35082:18"/>We ſee it plainly by the great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Effects of ſome few Mens Induſtry in every Age. Art hath found means to ſet Spies and Watches as it were on the <hi>Sun,</hi> that he cannot look out, but they take hold of his <hi>Shadow,</hi> and force it to tell how far he is gone that day: And yet while we are curious in making Time give a juſt Account of it ſelf to us, how little do we conſider the account of our Time, which we muſt ſhortly give to God? Oh! that ſuch a Thought might effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſuade me to redeem it! that I may not tarry till the end of Time, to know the worth of it! Let me not undervalue it, while 'tis given me to be uſed, that I may not eternally regret my Folly, when Time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>God calls me to Diligence and Labour; the <hi>Work</hi> he calls me to is excellent, and the <hi>Reward</hi> glorious; to know, and love, and ſerve, and obey Him, in order to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; and ſhall I yet be Idle?

               </argument>
               <p>WHen I conſider the beginning of another Year, I can hardly avoid reflecting on its ſeveral parts, Summer and Winter, Spring and Fall, Day and Night, and their alternate Turns. This calls me to obſerve, and admire his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Godhead, Wiſdom and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35082:19"/>Truth, who is the Great Author of this admirable variety; Who hath fixed the Earth with his Foot, and hanged it on nothing, and ſetled the Luminaries of Heaven for Excellent Ends: <hi>The Sun to Ruleby Day, and the Moon by Night,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſtinguiſh Times and Seaſons, to ſeparate Day and Night, Winter and Summer, and conſult the convenience of Man and Beaſt, by their due Succeſſion. <hi>The Day is thine, the Night alſo is thine, thou makeſt Summer and Winter:</hi> How wonderful is their Order, Beauty, and conſtant Courſe; that when the Sun withdraws, and the ſhadows of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cover the Earth with darkneſs, to conclude the <hi>Day;</hi> the Moon and Stars ſupply the place of the abſent Sun, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Night:</hi> And that tho' they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in length, yet gradually leſſen, till they are both equal at the years end, and have made the ſame Circuit. How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a work of God, is that quick ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another? The ſuppoſition of a <hi>perpetual Night,</hi> is a diſmal gloomy <hi>thought.</hi> O what will the Everlaſting Darkneſs of the Infernal Priſon be! The Sun by day enlightens the Earth, directs our Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, guides our Way, governs our Travail, aſſiſts Converſation, awakens Induſtry,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35082:20"/>warms the Earth, and Air, gives Life, and Vigor, and fruitfulneſs to all things under the Sun, and makes the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creation to rejoyce. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of God's univerſal Goodneſs, who is kind to all his Creatures. How ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable is its Luſtre! how glorious is its Light! how loudly doth it proclaim his Power and Wiſdom! who made this, and the other Lights of Heaven, by his powerful Word, and preſerves them hitherto by his daily Providence.</p>
               <p>If God be now ſo glorious, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated in his Works, conſidered in the luſtre of the created Sun, viewed only through the Windows of Senſe; how much more glorious will he appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when we ſhall ſee him face to face, and nothing interpoſe betwixt us and his incomparable Light! If mine Eyes dazle to look upon the meridian Sun, in what inacceſſible <hi>Light</hi> muſt he dwell, who is <hi>the Father of Lights?</hi> If this lower World the common receptacle of his Friends and Enemies, have ſo much of his Glory vouchſafed them by the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; O what a place will <hi>Heaven</hi> be, where ſhall be no <hi>Sun or Moon,</hi> nor need of any, <hi>but the glory of God ſhall lighten it, and the Lamb be the Light thereof?</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:35082:20"/>
               <p>While I thus conſider the Sun, and the Day, I muſt not think the <hi>Night</hi> is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, which diſcovers another part of the Heavens, not diſcernable by the Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Stars and Planets, refreſhing the Earth, cooling the Air, giving neceſſary Reſt to the Creatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their order, motions, aſpects, oppoſitions, influences, are all uſeful, and inſtructive. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable mixtures of Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the regular ſucceſſion of Day and Night within a few hours, are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderful, and advantageous. In other parts of the World, where the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams are more direct, and its heat exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, God hath made amends by the length of the <hi>Night,</hi> (under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Line it is always Twelve hours) and in the more Northen parts, where the Influence of the Sun is weaker, the <hi>days</hi> are proportionably longer. So good is God to all his Creatures, in all parts of the world. As the Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer to the day of Twenty four hours; ſo doth Spring and Autumn to the Twelve months of the Year, that we may not paſs immediately from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to another, but gradually be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ſo great a change, as is between Summer and Winter, and Winter and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35082:21"/>Summer. So merciful and gracious, and infinitely wiſe is God, in all his Works! ſo that we cannot ſay, one part of the Year is more neceſſary than another. The <hi>Winter</hi> is as uſeful for the good of the Univerſe, as the <hi>Summer:</hi> In <hi>this</hi> we are ſupplied with what is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us in <hi>that.</hi> And the admirable Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Sun (moſt probably) in the Center of the World, ſeems much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it. If it had been at a farther diſtance from us, our Earth would have been in a manner deſolate; becauſe the Influence of the Sun could not have been conſiderable: And if it had been nearer: the Stars above would have wanted Light, and this Earth under been burnt up. The Excellent Order which it hath now obeyed for above ſix Thouſand Years, is alſo wonderful. The Sun never ſtood ſtill but once, and that by a <hi>Miracle;</hi> tho' much inferiour to that of it's daily Progreſs. What a Subject is here to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Power, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Faithfulneſs of God? <hi>Lord! what is Man!</hi> For whom thou doſt all this? And becauſe I find every Year that the Day dies into Night, the Summer into Winter, and Herbs and Plants loſe their Beauty and Verdure, and ſhed their Bloſſoms;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35082:21"/>may I not hence learn to conſider, and prepare for my own Approaching Change? In Proſperity, Health, and Eaſe, and Life, to expect, and make Proviſion for Trouble, Sickneſs, Pain and Death? as every Wiſe Man in Summer would do for Winter; and work with all my Might, <hi>while it is called to day;</hi> while the Light continues, becauſe the Night of Darkneſs is at hand, when none can work.</p>

               <p>We ſometimes laugh to ſee the Vanity of <hi>little Children,</hi> who are greatly pleaſed with painted Toys, and buſily employed about Trifles.

Let me now therefore, O my Soul! look forward to the End of Life and Time! and ſo let me eſteem, and ſeek, and chooſe, and do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the firſt place, which then I ſhall wiſh I had; Let me do nothing now, which I verily believe I ſhall then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, or ſorry to reflect on; that by thinking what a Condition I ſhall then wiſh to have my Soul in, I may now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my ſelf, much better than I have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35082:26"/>done hitherto.

There are but</hi> three <hi>ways of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this World, as</hi> Abel, Adam, <hi>or</hi> Enoch. <hi>A diligent Improvement of Time farther preſt; and the Neglect of it bewailed.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THE ſhortning of our Days is the fruit of Sin. All the <hi>Funerals</hi> that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35082:26"/>have ever been in the World, have been cauſed by Sin. We dye becauſe we have ſinned, and yet we ſhould not ſin as now, if this were not forgot, that we <hi>muſt</hi> dye. From the firſt Tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> we derive our Death; and therefore ſome of his Poſterity lived longer than he. Which proves that the lengthning of our Days is the peculiar <hi>Gift</hi> of God; and yet 'tis ſuch a Gift, as was more deſired formerly, than ſince the Appearance of Chriſt: For we read of none in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince <hi>Life and Immortality is brought to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> who deſired a long Continuance here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Were we delivered from <hi>Sin,</hi> the ſting of Death, by having made our Peace with God in the Blood of Jeſus, Death would not be frightful, or put on ſuch a Ghaſtly Vizor, as to moſt it doth. But we are uncertain of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> we waver between Hopes and Fears as to our final Sentence; and are conſcious to our ſelves, that we are <hi>not ready</hi> for our great Account. This makes Death ſo terrible. Conſidering withal that it is inevitable; <hi>The Way of all the Living.</hi> For tho' the Curſe be removed, and the ſting be taken out by our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Souls</hi> of Believers are ſafe, and ſhall not be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35082:27"/>touch'd by the <hi>ſecond</hi> Death; yet God hath not taken away the ſtroke of it from the Body. Tho' a Chriſtian is aſſured of deliverance from <hi>Hell,</hi> he is not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Grave,</hi> as his Paſſage to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prepare me, <hi>Lord,</hi> by the free Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all my Sins, and make me meet for the Bleſſed Inheritance, by ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace; and then thy Time is beſt; <hi>Thy Holy Will be done,</hi> No matter then, whether my Death be <hi>violent,</hi> or what we call <hi>Natural.</hi> It will be one of the <hi>two,</hi> for I can't expect to be <hi>Tranſlated</hi> by a miraculous Change, as Holy <hi>Enoch</hi> was; and as they ſhall be, who ſhall be found alive in the World, when our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Judge ſhall come again. There are but thoſe <hi>three ways</hi> of leaving Earth; and the <hi>Three firſt Men</hi> of whoſe Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we read in Scripture, are Inſtances of all Three. <hi>Abel</hi> of a violent <hi>Death, Adam</hi> of a natural One, and <hi>Enoch</hi> of a Tranſlation. The Variety and Order of their Departure, as one obſerves, is very admirable, and deſerves to be conſidered. For all Mankind muſt follow one or other of thoſe <hi>three</hi> Examples. Every Man or Woman, that is born into the World, muſt leave it by one of thoſe <hi>three</hi> ways;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35082:27"/>either be cut off by a <hi>violent Death,</hi> as <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt Man who dyed; or dye a <hi>natural Death,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> did, who was the <hi>ſecond;</hi> or be <hi>tranſlated,</hi> as <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was the <hi>third</hi> we read of.</p>
               <p>But though I know, that within a few Years at fartheſt, I muſt leave this World by one or other of theſe ways; though I have been dying ever ſince I began to live; am Dead to the laſt Year, and to all the preceeding Portions of my Time; and know withal, that what remains will quickly paſs and be gone after the ſame manner; yet how have I overloved this Body, as if I ſhould never live out of it! and ſet my Heart and Affections on this World, as if I ſhould never remove to another! and trifled away my precious Time and Life, as if a change would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come!</p>
               <p>That <hi>Few</hi> do ſeriouſly admit ſuch Thoughts is too evident, by the general Courſe and Practice of their Lives. For to what Hazards do Men expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? what Pains will they take? what Inconveniences will they bear? with what unwearied Induſtry will they toyl and labour, to get a little Money, or Honour in this World, tho' they know not, but they may be called out of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35082:28"/>the End of <hi>this</hi> Year?

Others, whom a few Months ſince I knew in vigorous health; wiſer, ſtronger, more likely to live, and to anſwer the ends of Life, than me; ſome of them, my near Relations, and uſeful Friends, in whoſe Converſe I took delight, and promiſed my ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their Company, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but they are taken, and I am left. <hi>Thy Holy Will,</hi> O Lord! <hi>is done:</hi> and they, who were prepared, are infinite Gainers by this my loſs.

He hath the Keys of Death and Hell: He is the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the Life; he hath removed the

               <p>
                  <hi>I may dye this Year;</hi> and can I wonder that I am ſometimes <hi>Sick</hi> and in <hi>Pain,</hi> and that my <hi>Body</hi> is out of order?

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35082:38"/>'Tis a greater wonder, I am any time well: That ſuch a Body, compounded of ſo many little parts; and ſo eaſily diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by innumerable accidents, ſhould be in Health; is hardly leſs to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than that an Inſtrument of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrings ſhould be kept in Tune.</p>
               <p>I thank thee, <hi>O heavenly Father,</hi> for the many advantages of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the power of <hi>Sin,</hi> to humble my <hi>Pride,</hi> and cure my Worldlineſs and Senſuality, to reduce me from wandering, to empty me of Self-conceit, to awaken the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Death and Judgment, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Thoughts of the vanity of this World, and the Eternity of the next; to aſſiſt me to mortifie the Fleſh, to rule my Paſſions, to exerciſe Patience, and quicken me in Prayer, and try my Faith and Love, and excite my diligence to redeem time, and convince me of the Worth and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of it; and thereby promote my Preparations for my final change.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35082:39"/>more formidable, as to the meer Pain; and for all elſe, the Righteous Lord who loveth Righteouſneſs, will clear my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, if it may beſt ſubſerve his own Great and Holy Ends: At leaſt, he will ſtand by and help me, when all forſake me; and if He ſpeak <hi>Peace,</hi> and give <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conſolation,</hi> who can ſpeak <hi>Trouble?</hi> And his final Judgment, which is near at hand, will diſtribute rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all, according to their works.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe farther, that I ſhould <hi>want a Scpulcher,</hi> after Death. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I could better be without. If God receive my <hi>Soul,</hi> and will raiſe my <hi>Body</hi> at the laſt day, whether it putrifie and conſume under ground, or above it, is no great matter. They who are alive will be more concerned in that, than I ſhall be; Graves are for the ſake of the <hi>Living</hi> rather than the Dead. The Sun, the Rain, the Air, Birds, Beaſts, Worms, will all contribute to give me <hi>Burial,</hi> if Men deny it. The only difference is, that it will be a little longer e're I am buried. If my Soul reſt in the Boſom of my Saviour, and by preſevering in the love and practice of the Truth, I have ſecured my Reputation with wiſe and good Men, I need not be ſollicitous

Let me ſtill remember, O my Soul! that where ever I am, I am travelling towards the Grave, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to another World: That I may live in all places, as a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> and <hi>Stranger</hi> here on Earth; with Affections ſuited to my condition, becoming one who is travelling in a Strange Land. Let me bear the Inconveniences I may meet with in this World, as Strangers in their Travels are wont to do. Let me not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the ill Accommodations of an <hi>Inn,</hi> where I am to lodge but a night or two;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35082:41"/>but encourage my ſelf with the aſſurance of better Entertainment at home, when my Pilgrimage is ended, and my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney over.</p>

Which of his Companions ſhall next follow, we know not, or how ſoon. Lord! Make me apprehend the nearneſs of my change in every place; and if I am prepared for dying, no matter <hi>where</hi> it be. There is no one Country farther from the Preſence of God than another. The whole World may be conſidered as one Great Houſe, and the ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countries of it, but as different <hi>Apartments</hi> in the ſame Houſe; and they who tarry at home, are no more exempt from <hi>Death,</hi> than they who travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fullneſs thereof;</hi> I can go no where to be out of his Territories, I ſhall ſtill tread upon my Father's Ground. I had rather be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35082:42"/>an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in a Wilderneſs with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, than a Courtier in idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Aegypt. Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and the Friend of God, was baniſhed from his own Country; and ſhould I never ſet foot again on my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soyl, there is no reaſon of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt my God, who hath dealt thus with many of his Favourites. And while I have been in a ſtrange Land, he hath not ſuffered me to feel the wants and neceſſities, and <hi>heart of a Stranger.</hi> Among a People of a ſtrange <hi>Language</hi> he can, and doth provide for me all things richly to enjoy. I may ſet up my <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> hitherto hath God ſupplied all my wants.</p>
               <p>The Preſence of my Gracious Father is every where the <hi>ſame;</hi> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Bleſſed be my God,</hi> I have hitherto found it ſo. And may I not rejoyce in God in a Deſert, though all the World ſhould forſake me; though all the World ſhould be againſt me? Should I have no other Friend or Helper; is not God, an infinite God <hi>Enough?</hi> and without his Favour and Preſence, what can all this World do for me? If I am <hi>ſick,</hi> and in danger of Death, among my <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Friends;</hi> if <hi>the comforts of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:35082:42"/>do not refreſh and delight my Soul, <hi>they</hi> cannot: And if I want not <hi>theſe</hi> in my laſt Agonies, no matter in what part or corner of the Earth I breath my laſt. If the word and promiſe of God be my Foundation, an holy Hope my Anchor, Chriſt my Pilot, and Heaven my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſhall not fail of being landed there at laſt. Suffer me not to forſake thee, <hi>O Heavenly Father!</hi> while I live; and do not thou forſake me in my <hi>laſt Hour;</hi> and let it come <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> thou wilt! If my bleſſed Saviour will receive my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Soul at Death, I am not ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in what Country or part of the Earth it be.</p>
               <p>And that I may not be unwilling in the flower of my Age and Time, <hi>in Youth and Strength,</hi> to leave this World; let me think often, that no one age or part of Life is more priviledged againſt the ſtroke of Death than another. If I have done my work betimes, as my deceaſed <hi>Fellow Traveller</hi> had, is it not better to receive the bleſſed Recompence, than to to tarry longer, in a World of Sin and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, abſent from the Lord? Shall I not thereby eſcape a multitude of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Sins, and Sorrows, which others by living longer are expoſed to? If my
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35082:43"/>Peace be made with God, what ſhould make me willing to live at this diſtance from him? What ſhould render this World ſo deſirable, where God is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, where I am ſo often tempted to diſpleaſe him, and ſo often yield to ſuch Temptations? And may I not fear leſt I ſhould fall into ſuch ſcandalous and grievous ſins, that may bring a publick reproach on the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſadden the Hearts of all my Acquaintance, who love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity? By dying early, I ſhall contract leſs guilt, and commit leſs ſin, and ſee and feel leſs <hi>Sorrow</hi> than others who live longer. And tho' I ſhould maintain my Integrity, yet in this World my higheſt love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and my ſweeteſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, is but imperfect. How many Impediments and Diverſions do I daily meet with, that deaden my Heart to Heavenly Contemplations and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? What diſappointments, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful diſaſters, to convince me that <hi>this</hi> is not the place of Reſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? What ſmart afflictions may ſome of my <hi>Relations</hi> prove? What dangerous Snares may attend me in the remaining Portion of my Time?

               </p>
               <p>But if I conſider <hi>Old Age</hi> it ſelf, which we do deſire to reach; what and how many are the Infirmities and Griefs, and troubleſome Circumſtances which attend that State, which dying young will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? Are not moſt Men, who reach a very great old Age, helpleſs Objects of Pity? A Burthen to themſelves, and to all about them? And (which commonly happens,) may I not <hi>then</hi> be as unwilling to dye, as at preſent? As loth <hi>then</hi> to leave the World as <hi>now,</hi> tho' in a manner it will have left me? For how many Old Men, paſt the Reliſh of Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are yet inordinately fond of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Life!</p>
               <p>Have I not been told by <hi>Heathens,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> that 'tis not the length of time, but it's improvement, that doth really make a <hi>Long Life?</hi> If I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Ends for which I were born, 'tis not <hi>too ſoon</hi> to dye. No Man ever miſcarried as to his Everlaſting Intereſt, becauſe his <hi>Life</hi> was <hi>Short,</hi> but <hi>Evil.</hi> He that is prepared for Death, he that dyes <hi>in the Lord,</hi> hath lived long enough, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35082:44"/>ſhould thank God for a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> Call to the Poſſeſſion of that <hi>Felicity,</hi> which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Saints on Earth deſire and breath after. <hi>Gideon</hi> loſt nothing by returning from Victory, <hi>while the Sun was yet high.</hi> He hath fought long enough who hath gained the Victory. If I have wrought but a few Hours in a Vineyard, and done but little Service for my Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and yet am diſmiſt, and rewarded, before the reſt of my Fellow-Labourers; ſhall I repine, and think my Lord doth not befriend me? If he hath any farther Service for me, he will prolong my Days, and make me Diligent, I hope, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi> Otherwiſe I pray he would make me ready to dye, and make me <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>deſirous</hi> to depart this Life. For to be only <hi>content</hi> to dye, that I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Holy, and fully Bleſſed, is methinks too low for a Chriſtian, who acts like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; believing the Certainty of his avowed Principles and Hopes, and knowing, that <hi>While we are preſent in the Body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Contemplation of our Approaching</hi> Change, <hi>may aſſiſt us to mortifie the</hi> Luſts <hi>of the</hi> Fleſh, <hi>the</hi> Luſt <hi>of the</hi> Eyes, <hi>and the</hi> Pride <hi>of</hi> Life; <hi>to cure</hi> Ambition, <hi>and promote</hi> Contentment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL that is in the World, ſaith the Apoſtle, is <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> The Duſt and Aſhes of our own Mortality, duly conſidered and applied; will help to deaden, and extinguiſh each of theſe. By <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> we lift up our ſelves againſt Heaven, and deſpiſe our Maker; by <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> we overlove and indulge the Body, and ſtudy to gratifie the ſenſual Appetite: By <hi>the Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> our Deſires are immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate after Temporal and External Goods. The thought of our approaching End hath a Tendency to oppoſe and mortifie <hi>theſe Luſts;</hi> to humble us before God; to take us off from the inordinate Love of the Body; and to moderate our Paſſions to Earthly Things. It may help us againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> by ſhewing us the infinite diſtance, between the Eternal Self-ſufficient God,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35082:45"/>and ſuch poor Duſt as we; who are but of Yeſterday, and if he uphold us not, and maintain our Souls in Life ſhall be laid in the Duſt to Morrow: It will mind us of his Juſtice againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> the Parent of <hi>Death,</hi> and of all the Miſeries of our mortal State; and convince us of our Weakneſs to reſiſt his Will, or avoid his Wrath. As to our <hi>fond Affection</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> it may inſtruct us, that it deſerves not to be ſo much accounted of; it will open our Eyes to diſcern the Preference of our immortal Souls; and what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, to the Intereſt of a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body. It may convince us, that we are <hi>Cruel</hi> and unkind to our very <hi>Bodies,</hi> by overloving them, becauſe we thereby contribute to their Eternal Sufferings; and ſo teach us to love and uſe our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Servants to our Souls in this World! and as expecting to ſhare in Glory with them, after the Reſurrection. It may alſo help to <hi>moderate</hi> our <hi>Deſires</hi> after Earthly Good, and ſo cure the <hi>Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> by letting us ſee the Vanity, Uncertainty, and ſhort Duration of theſe Things, and their Inſufficiency to make us Happy, and give us true Content.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts of an Approaching Change may, if any thing will do it,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35082:45"/>damp the Mirth of the <hi>Luxurious Epicure,</hi> and ſtrike him into a fit of Trembling, as did <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s Hand-writing on the Wall. It may diſcover the Diſtraction of living in Pleaſure, and of Care to pleaſe the Senſes, and the fleſhly Appetite, when the End is ſo near. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe check the Folly of <hi>Ambitious Deſigns;</hi> that Men ſhould make ſo much ado to get into ſlippery Places, from whence they may ſo eaſily fall. Where being puft up with vain Applauſe, they forget themſelves, and their latter End, 'till their Life and Glory expire together: Where are now the Great, and Mighty, and Honourable, who have made ſuch a Noiſe in the World? What is now the <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>Duſt</hi> of an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that of their meaneſt Slaves or Captives? Could their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Earthly Glory preſerve any of them, from the Stroke of Death, or the Judgment of God, or without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, from his condemning Sentence?</p>
               <p>Think, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> how little it will ſhortly ſignifie, whether I have been known and honoured among Men or no; any farther than God may be glorified by it. How ſhould it ſuppreſs Vain-Glory? to think of being <hi>one day</hi> eſteemed, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35082:46"/>worſhipt, reverenced, and applauded by dying Men, and laid in the Grave <hi>the next?</hi> Let me rather ſeek that Glory and Honour, to which <hi>Immortality</hi> is annext; and labour to be accepted with God, at whoſe Bar I muſt be judged, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience; and then it is not much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I paſs through Good Report or Evil Report; no Contempt, or Frowns, or Threatnings of Men need then diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me. Tho' I ſhould be trampled on by the Foot of Pride, while others are happy in a Dream for a little while; and it may be have a proſperous Paſſage to Damnation; I'll rather thank God, for delivering me from their Temptations, and giving me the Opportunity, and Call, to haſten my Preparations for <hi>a Better World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let God diſpoſe of my Condition here, and <hi>Reputation</hi> too, as beſt ſhall pleaſe his Sovereign Will; only be pleaſed to keep me upright, and to preſerve me from Everlaſting Shame and Confuſion of Face, after the general Reſurrection, and final Judgment. Vouchſafe me a Portion now in thine approving Love, and own me for <hi>Thine</hi> at laſt, in the great and terrible Day of Reckoning;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35082:46"/>that then I may hear the Bleſſed <hi>Euge,</hi> and enter into my Lord's Joy?</p>

Have I nothing elſe to do, but to gather Shells, (if they were <hi>Pearls,</hi> the abſurdity were ſtill the ſame) and pile them upon Heaps, till I am ſnacht away paſt all Recovery? Shall I be regardleſs of an Eternal State, and run the Hazard of being undone for ever, by ſollicitous Care about pretended <hi>Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> for a long Abode on Earth? [Much leſs for <hi>Superfluities;</hi>] when I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Poſſeſſion, <hi>this one Year?</hi> Shall I magnifie and admire what is ſo ſoon to be parted with? Value my ſelf upon theſe Things, ſo as to Deſpiſe thoſe that have <hi>leſs,</hi> and-Envy ſuch as have <hi>more?</hi> and ſuffer my Mind to be diſtempered, and my Paſſions immoderate on every Change of theſe things?</p>
               <p>Tho' I know beſides my own Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that to inforce the Argument, there is a Principle of <hi>Corruption</hi> in all theſe Things; that our very <hi>Manna</hi> here, in a little while will ſtink; and <hi>Bread,</hi> which is the Staff of Life, moulder; our richeſt <hi>Garments</hi> wax old, and rot; <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> ruſt, and the greateſt <hi>Beauty</hi> wither, and every thing that is <hi>Earthly,</hi> decay

Can I imagine, that in my laſt Hour it will be <hi>eaſier</hi> to part with <hi>much,</hi> than little? Or better in the Day of Judgment, to have a great Eſtate to anſwer for, than a leſſer One?</p>
               <p>We read concerning the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> (who rightly underſtood the Tranſitory Nature of Riches, and his own mutable Condition,) that the only <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> he made with his Riches, was a <hi>Grave;</hi> chuſing to take Poſſeſſion of the Land promiſed him, rather by a Mark of his parting with it, than of his poſſeſſing it. Did I think oftner and more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> of tarrying here but a little while; I ſhould more eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that a <hi>little</hi> of this World were ſufficient to carry me through it. I ſhould conſider more that my <hi>Heaven-born Soul</hi> is made and deſigned for another, an Endleſs World: And therefore, ſhould not ſo far <hi>forget his own People,</hi> and <hi>Fathers Houſe;</hi> as eagerly to purſue and ſeek what is ſuited only to the <hi>Body,</hi> for a little while; and whereof a little with Contentment will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:35082:48"/>
               <p>The ſame Reflection may be uſeful to contract our Thoughts to <hi>preſent Duty;</hi> that we may not perplex our Minds with <hi>long Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Projects;</hi> which if we dye <hi>this</hi> Year, will come to nothing. Our great Buſineſs in this World is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the little Portion of Time, which is allowed us.

               <p>IN this World we begin a Year, and quickly come to the End of it; and e're long the little Number of our Years, and Days will be expired. But when Death conveys us into the World of

               <p>Let me therefore, endeavour to impreſs the conſideration of <hi>Eternity, as at hand,</hi> more deeply on my Heart, that I may walk, and live, diſcourſe, and pray, and demean my ſelf in every thing, as <hi>near</hi> an unchangeable State. Am I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that this is certain, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and operations of my Soul, from the reflections of Conſcience, from the Righteouſneſs of God in his Government of the World, from the preſent unequal diſtributions of Good and Evil by his Providence, and from the plain and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent aſſertions of his Revealed Will? I have nothing to object, nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but I find a neceſſity of inculcating
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35082:50"/>and urging the conſideration of it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its influence. I find it needful to reflect often, how <hi>near</hi> I am to ſuch an endleſs State; that in <hi>one Inſtant,</hi> by Death, I enter upon it: And that <hi>this Inſtant</hi> may be as near me, as my <hi>next Thoughts.</hi> That the holy Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, the two contrary Conditions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, (and every Man and Woman in the World ſhall ſhare in one of them) as both Everlaſting; the one, by <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, Eternal Glory, an incorruptible Crown, that fadeth not away, an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Inheritance, an Houſe Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. the other, <hi>by unquenchable Fire, a Priſon whence no eſcape, Eternal Damnation, Everlaſting Burning, Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhment, Everlaſting Deſtruction, a Worm that never dies, wrath that is ever to come, blackneſs of darkneſs for ever, ever,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Think, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> that in <hi>One</hi> of theſe two contrary States, I muſt abide <hi>for ever,</hi> in endleſs Joy, or Sorrow: Bleſſed in the Preſence of God, or for ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it. And whoever thou art that readeſt this, apply it ſeriouſly to thy ſelf, <hi>'tis thine own caſe.</hi> Yea, I tell thee from God, that Holineſs of Heart
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35082:51"/>and Life is abſolutely Neceſſary to the former, and that without it, thou ſhalt never ſee his Face; but be puniſhed with Everlaſting Deſtruction, from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Glory.</p>
               <p>Is this an Unqueſtionable Truth? O let me conſider it, till I feel the Power and Efficacy, of ſo Important a Principle! let the Impreſſion be Deep and Laſting! let it pierce and enter into my very Soul! to cool the Heats of Luſt, to quench Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and Earthly deſires, and to mortifie all Inordinate Affections to this World; and fix my Reſolutions to mind, and ſeek Eternal Life with all my Heart!</p>
               <p>Theſe are not difficult and perplexed <hi>Niceties,</hi> which wiſe and holy Men differ and diſagree about. They are not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphiſical Subtleties, which few can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; but the expreſs Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the daily Dictates of my own Reaſon and Conſcience, which all Chriſtians, and almoſt all Men in their Wits (except in an Hour of great Temptation) confeſs and own; or whether they will or no, are forced to expect and fear, if they are not in a Condition, to conſider them with a joyful Hope.</p>

None of the Patriarchs who lived longeſt, arrived to the period of <hi>a Thouſand Years,</hi> which in compariſon of God's Everlaſtingneſs, is ſet forth but <hi>as one day.</hi> But ſtrictly conſidered, Millions of Years and Ages have <hi>no proportion</hi> with it; becauſe no multiplication of them will amount to <hi>Eternity.</hi> Whereas one Hour hath <hi>ſome</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:35082:52"/>proportion to an hundred thouſand years, becauſe a certain number of Hours will amount to ſo many years.

When innumerable myriads of Years are paſt, Eternity ſhall then ſeem but to begin, becauſe when as many more are over, it ſhall be as far from an end.</p>
               <p>Oh! that the thoughts of Eternity may be powerful, and prevailing above all others! that I may Judge of every thing by its relation to it, by its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it!

               <p>THE Fear of the Lord is the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of Wiſdom, the entrance into the way of Life, as it is ordinarily one of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35082:53"/>the <hi>firſt</hi> Means to awaken the Soul to a ſerious Concern for Eternity: Let me therefore firſt conſider the <hi>Endleſs Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> of the Wicked, in the other World, before I enter upon the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proſpect of the Bleſſedneſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, promiſed to the Righteous.

The <hi>Dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of that Puniſhment, the Endleſs <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of it, joyned to the Conſideration of its Unqueſtionable <hi>Certainty;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the moſt Attentive Thoughts of every Man, who loves his Soul, and would manifeſt he doth ſo, by ſecuring his greateſt Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Deſcription of that Miſery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Inſupportable and Eternal Torments, demands more than a Tranſient View; becauſe no words can ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Horror of that State.

Add to this, his being enraged by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and Cries of wicked <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and <hi>Relations;</hi> and his being mockt, and inſulted over, and tortured, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious damned <hi>Spirits;</hi> with a clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that glorious Felicity he deſpiſed, refuſed, and forfeited; with a deep Senſe of his former <hi>Madneſs,</hi> in preferring the Sinful Pleaſures and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this World; and this after ſo many Warnings, and Invitations, and Calls from God, to have prevented it; and never to be diverted one moment from the Conſideration, Senſe, and Feeling of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35082:54"/>his Miſery, and the duration of it; to have all his <hi>Paſſions</hi> let looſe, with the greateſt violence, and nothing to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them; and continually to preſerve, an <hi>Hell</hi> of wickedneſs and Horror <hi>in himſelf;</hi> and to endure the reproaches, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, regrets, and ſtinging Reflections of Conſcience, <hi>the gnawing Worm, which ſhall never die:</hi> Who can conceive the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable miſery of ſuch an accurſed State? <hi>So great Calamity,</hi> and yet <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting!</hi>

               <p>What Groans and Cries, will theſe Thoughts and theſe Sufferings, wring from their Hearts?

               <p>The vain Hopes of Sinners ſhall then be ended in Eternal Deſperation: <hi>Hell</hi> will be full of thoſe, who did once <hi>hope</hi> they ſhould never come <hi>there:</hi> And full of thoſe who <hi>deſpair</hi> of Deliverance from thence; but ſhall ſuffer exquiſitive Pains that cannot be numbred, or meaſured, or endured; but that every <hi>Minute</hi> of an Hour will ſeem an whole Year, and yet muſt <hi>eternally</hi> be endured by miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinners, who will not be wiſe in time, to prevent ſuch an intollerable Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Let me therefore, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into <hi>Hell</hi> by Meditation, whilſt I live, that I may not deſcend thither when I dye; and be ſhut up for ever in that Priſon, the Place of Endleſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Might we but ſuppoſe, that one of thoſe Miſerable Souls did let fall but <hi>one Tear,</hi> in an <hi>Hundred Thouſand</hi> Years; and if after he had by this means wept ſo much, as that his Tears would equal the <hi>Drops</hi> of Water in the whole <hi>Sea;</hi>

               <p>In very many other Caſes, the Faith of <hi>this Article</hi> would rectifie my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and direct my Actions, if ſeriouſly conſidered and improved. This would make me think of <hi>Death</hi> under another Notion, than 'tis commonly conſidered. For without the Conſideration of <hi>Hell</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, it is not ſo very formidable, but that <hi>Heathens</hi> have been able to deſpiſe it. The moſt Contrary Sects among them, on different Grounds have been able to do it; but conſider <hi>Death</hi> as a Paſſage to Eternal Miſery, as the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35082:59"/>Gate of Hell, as the End of all Comfort to a Wicked Man, and the Beginning of an Endleſs Calamity, and nothing can be imagined more <hi>dreadful</hi> to a Guilty, Unholy Soul. Some of my <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> it may be, who died this laſt Year, are now among thoſe Hopeleſs, Deſpairing Wretches, who expect the final Judgment of God, to conſummate their inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Miſery. If they were permitted to come, and tell us what they ſuffer, and what they know; what a Terrible <hi>Conſuming Fire</hi> God is; what Vanity, Luſt, and Folly, brought them to this Place of Torment; what Diligence they would adviſe us to, while in a State of Hope, to prevent the like; if we have any Love and Kindneſs for our ſelves, any Bowels of Compaſſion to our own Souls; What a Change do we think it would work upon us? But if we will not <hi>hear</hi> Moſes; <hi>and the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles;</hi> neither ſhould we believe, tho' one came from the Dead.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35082:60"/>Soul, in this diſtant Wilderneſs ſtate! Let me ſee more of thy Light! be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd more into thine Image! expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience more of thy Love! feel more of thy vital Preſence, and quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Let the Divine Life in my Soul be more powerful, and the Characters of thy Likeneſs be more legibly ſtampt upon it! by the daily Exerciſe of Faith, and Hope, and Holy Affections, carry me through this World! 'till my Pilgrim ſtate be over, and thou haſt brought me to <hi>perfect, Everlaſting Holineſs!</hi> And let the believing Fore-thoughts of it, fill all the Powers of my Soul with Joy, and Wonder, Deſire and Love!</p>
               <p>Give me, <hi>Lord!</hi> to think aright of the Heavenly Glory; as a Confirmed State of poſitive, perfect <hi>Holineſs;</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light, Love, Liberty and Joy, with the ſatisfying Viſion of God, in the Face of Chriſt, and his impreſſed Likeneſs; dwelling for ever in the direct, and ſteady View of his Transforming Glory; with compleat Conformity of the Soul to Eternal Goodneſs, Truth and Love, as its Perfection; eſteeming nothing, deſiring nothing, but that God and Chriſt may be glorified, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35082:61"/>Subjection to his Will, Adherence to him; Reſt and Confidence in him, Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Love, Admiration, and Praiſe of God, and our Lord Jeſus; living in joyful repeated Acts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Adoration, and Acknowledg'd Dependance; raviſh'd to behold the Glory of God, in the Face of Chriſt, to ſee his bleſſed Image perfect in every one of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Blindneſs of our Minds, the Errors of our Judgment, the Perverſeneſs of our Will, the Diſorder and Rebellion of our Paſſions, the remaining Averſation from God, and Diſaffection to him, which in this World we complain of, ſhall all be done away: The Fleſh ſhall no more luſt againſt the Spirit; or the Law in our Members againſt the Law of our Minds; but an Everlaſting Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and Holy Peace take place; a <hi>Peace</hi> which paſſeth all Underſtanding, without any outward Moleſtation, or inward Cauſe of Diſquiet.</p>
               <p>Our corrupted Nature ſhall no more caſt forth Mire and Dirt as now; we ſhall have no more vain, or wicked Thoughts, no more ſinful Fears, or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Hopes; unbecoming Heats, unruly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35082:61"/>Deſires, Senſual Inclinations, Earthly Affections, Feeble, Sloathful, Spiritleſs Duties, Dead and Heartleſs Prayers, Cold Thankſgivings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as we ſhall then know God without Errors, and ſee our Lord Jeſus Face to Face; ſo we ſhall love him without reſerve, more than now we can think; and ſerve him without Dulneſs and Diſtraction, and Praiſe him without Wearineſs; the Spiritual Actings of our Souls ſhall have no Allay of Droſs. And thus ſhall we be with him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and injoy him, <hi>without end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in Victory;</hi> and what was imperfect is done away, and what was Corruptible and Mortal, hath put on Immortality; <hi>God in Chriſt, ſhall be All in All:</hi> And when it is truly and perfectly ſo, <hi>Then it is Heaven.</hi> The Bleſſedneſs whereof is Unconceivable. A <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Perſon, is not expreſt in the Singular Number by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but in the Abſtract, and in the Plural. <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> becauſe the Bleſſings are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great, as they have Powers and Capacities to partake of Bleſſedneſs. So will it be in <hi>Heaven.</hi> A Word, tho' commonly uſed as little underſtood, as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35082:62"/>
                  <hi>Holineſs;</hi> which is one of the greateſt Myſteries in the World; but will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be fully and delightfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Bleſſed Saints; as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and Intrinſick Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall be, by the damned Spirits.</p>
               <p>Oh, that I might now feel more of this Heavenly Life, begun and carried on in my Soul, by a farther Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Holy Image, and Conformity to his Will! by more vital Effects of his indwelling Spirit in my Soul, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a Temple to himſelf, for his own Delightful Reſidence! that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that, which I have received, I may ſtill be Coveting, and deſirous of more; forgetting what I have attain'd, I may preſs on, with an Holy Eagerneſs and Fervency, towards the Mark!</p>
               <p>When I ſeriouſly examine my own Heart, had I nothing elſe, to prove the Weakneſs of my Grace, and the ſinful Remainders of Unbelief, but the low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and few Comfortable Thoughts, the ſeldom joyful Proſpect of this Bleſſed State; how ſad an Evidence were it of my low Attainments, that I breath with no more Impatience, after that <hi>Bleſſed, Holy Reſt,</hi> in the Injoyment of God and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35082:62"/>Chriſt; and labour no more in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for it? When we profeſs to believe, that all the Deſires of our Souls ſhall be fix'd on <hi>Him,</hi> and filled with <hi>Him,</hi> as our <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Supreme Good;</hi> and all the Expectations of Faith and Hope, ſwallowed up in Endleſs Admiration, Gratitude and Joy; being fully ſatisfied, and at Reſt, in the Preſence and Viſion of God; without the leaſt Inclination, or Deſire of Change. And by Conſequence,</p>
               <p>There will be no need of <hi>Novelty,</hi> as now, to a give a Reliſh to our Happineſs. All Happineſs in this World is, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Man's preſent Condition, with his paſt, or with that of ſome Inferiours. But the Intrinſick Good, Felicity, and Joy of Heaven, will need no ſuch <hi>Foil</hi> to ſet it off; no ſuch Compariſon to make it prized. The Bleſſed Spirits will never loſe the lively Senſe, of that low and miſerable Condition, from which they were raiſed to ſo great a Glory; and ſo will ever equally rejoyce in the Happineſs of their Tranſlation and Wonderful Change. And what was at <hi>firſt</hi> delightful, will <hi>for Ever</hi> be ſo; and not diſdain'd, or leſſen'd by a Continuance; as it happens in this World, from the Emptineſs, Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35082:63"/>and Vanity of the Creature. An Affectation of <hi>Variety,</hi> and Deſire of <hi>Change,</hi> proceeding always from a Senſe of <hi>Want.</hi> But Holy Souls ſhall never be weary of Seeing, Loving, and Enjoying God; his Bleſſed Preſence will afford us Undecaying and Endleſs Satisfacton; Pleaſure, never to be interupted, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and never to ceaſe. The Bleſſed <hi>Object</hi> is abſolutely <hi>Infinite,</hi> and ſo will be always <hi>new</hi> to a Finite Underſtanding; and Continual Freſh Communications from his Infinite Fulneſs, muſt needs make our Subjective Happineſs to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>new,</hi> and Eternally ſuch.</p>
               <p>Let me by ſuch Thoughts, quicken and excite my Diligent Endeavours; after a greater Meetneſs to injoy ſo great a Bliſs. And to that end, Conſider, whether any of thoſe Happy Souls, who have finiſht their Courſe, and obtained the Prize, do now regret their utmoſt Diligence, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Perſeverance, during their ſhort Abode here, to ſecure the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Endleſs Life: <hi>No, no,</hi> they are far from repenting the Time they ſpent, the Trouble they were at, the Care they uſed, the Difficulties they met with, the Sufferings they endured; to conflct with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35082:63"/>the World, and the Fleſh, to reſiſt Temptation, to watch over their Hearts, and Words, and Ways, to work out their Salvation, to pleaſe God, and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They find to their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort, and Everlaſting Joy, that <hi>Heaven</hi> makes amends for <hi>all;</hi> they could do or ſuffer, in order to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>thither.</hi> Yea, they find that they were not Diligent, and Humble, and Patient, and Circumſpect enough. That they did not love God, and ſeek his Glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem their Time, and improve all their Talents, and Opportunities of doing and receiving Good, and give up themſelves intirely to prepare for Heaven, to that degree they ſhould have done. They find, by the Tranſcendency of the Bleſſed Recompence; that it deſerved infinitely <hi>more</hi> than the moſt Active, Zealous Chriſtian upon Earth did ever do; in order to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord!</hi> Quicken my Reſolutions and Endeavours, by ſuch Thoughts as theſe. Inſpire my Sluggiſh, Carnal Heart, with Holy Light, and Life, and Zeal, and Fervour! that <hi>looking to the Things which are not ſeen, which are Eternal;</hi> I may

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35082:64"/>to come, and ſo lay hold on Eternal Life!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Alas!</hi> How much have I neglected the great Duty of Holy <hi>Meditation?</hi> How little Skill and Experience have I in it? How taſtleſs and inſpid oftentimes are my Thoughts of God! how confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and unſteady! how little Pleaſure or Advantage have I, by Contemplating his Higheſt Excellencies? Yet, methinks, could I but retain the ſame awakened, lively Thoughts of Heaven, and Eternal Life, which <hi>ſometimes</hi> I have had; might I continually feel the Sweet and Sacred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, as for a <hi>little Seaſon</hi> I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times felt it; how little, how very a <hi>Nothing,</hi> would all <hi>this World</hi> be to me! How comparatively weak, its ſtrongeſt and moſt alluring Snares, to draw me off from God! with what an unſhaken Mind could I refuſe and reſiſt 'em! with what an unconcerned <hi>Indifference,</hi> could I look upon all its moſt charming Glory!</p>
               <p>Could I maintain ſuch a Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as I have ſometimes had for a little while; in the ſerious Contemplation of Divine Miſteries, in Fervent Prayers, and other Solemn Duties of Religion; when the Acts of Faith were ſtrong and lively, my Heart ſet on fire with Love to God, and Holy Breathings after Him;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35082:64"/>admiring his matchleſs Grace to fallen Sinners, (and to my Soul in particular) when he brought me to the very Suburbs of Heaven, (tho' <hi>alas!</hi> how <hi>ſeldom!</hi>) by the delightful Thought of what the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirits above enjoy, in being where Chriſt is, and beholding his Glory; when I was ready to ſay within my ſelf, <hi>'Tis good to be here; this is no other than the Gate of Heaven; Oh! when ſhall Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be ſwallowed up of Life!</hi> But when I thought at any time, to fix and ſettle in ſuch ſweet Contemplations; how quickly did my lazy, backward Heart fly off! how ſoon did the Flame decay and dye away! how ſoon did I find my ſelf fallen down to Earth again! ſunk down from the Boſom of my Lord, preſently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got my ſelf and Heaven, to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pots, and embrace a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill! 'Twas not on my own Wings, <hi>O Lord!</hi> that I ſoared ſo high; but I hope, by the Breathings of that Holy Spirit of Light and Love, who bloweth when, and where, and how long he liſteth; who gave me at any time, any ſuch <hi>firſt Fruits of the Spirit;</hi> who convinc'd me of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by a lively believing Foreſight of it; who made me earneſtly deſire the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35082:65"/>Wings of a Dove to be gone, and appear before God in <hi>Sion;</hi> made me Pant and Groan to be delivered, and to be with God and Chriſt, with inexpreſſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Joy, unconceivably mixt with Sighs and Groans. <hi>O my God!</hi> let not this experience be only ſuch a <hi>Taſte</hi> of the Powers of the World to come, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>final Apoſtacy!</hi> only the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal of the ſtony Ground! the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Joy of an Hypocite! from the Power of Imagination, and a heated Fancy; from the workings of meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Self-love; upon Miſtaken Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, and a falſe Opinion of Heaven; but by the Holy Effects, let me be aſſured of the Cauſe and Principle; that was of God.</p>
               <p>Teach me, from the Sweetneſs of all Spiritual Communion with God <hi>now,</hi> in any of his appointed Ordinances; to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to my ſelf, what the moſt raviſhing Satisfaction will be; that the Enjoyment of God in Heaven will afford the Soul. Our Holineſs is now imperfect, to what it ſhall be; and therefore our Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Peace and Joy, is but <hi>in part;</hi> and incomparably leſs than we are aſſured it will be, when we ſhall be admitted to behold the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord. 'Tis now
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35082:65"/>at moſt, but as the Break of Day, to the Luſtre of the Meridian Sun. But if in this low imperfect State, we can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obtain ſo near a View of his Glory, and feel ſuch ſweet Communications of his Grace; how much more of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Joy, is reſerved to Heaven? If in this Pilgrim State, the Gifts and Graces, and Comforts of the Holy Spirit are ſo refreſhing: O! what hath God prepared beyond the Grave, for thoſe who love him? If now he ſometimes ſhed abroad his Love in our Hearts, after ſuch a Manner; how much better ſhall I love him, and feel the Influence, and Evidence of his Love to me; when I ſhall be with him, and ſee him Face to Face? If the Apprehenſions of this Future Bleſſedneſs, do now encourage, raiſe, and animate my drooping Soul: O, what ſhall I know and ſee? And how ſhall I rejoyce, when the Vail is removed? If a Sacramental Communion with God and Jeſus Chriſt, be ſometimes ſo ſweet, and ſo affecting; what will the Bleſſed Communion with God, and all his Saints <hi>above,</hi> amount to? when I ſhall ſit down with all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in the Preſence of the Bridegroom, at the laſt Great Supper of the Lamb in Glory! If the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35082:66"/>our Inheritance be ſo reviving, what will be the full Poſſeſſion of it? If the Hopes of that Glorious Day, by Holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be ſo tranſporting; what will be the End of our Faith and Hope? If a Grape or two in the Wilderneſs, be ſuch a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; what will be the whole Vintage in the Land of Promiſe?</p>
               <p>Shall I after all this, forget my own <hi>Experience,</hi> and run from God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to embrace or ſeek a periſhing Toy? Shall I hide my ſelf with <hi>Saul,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Stuff and Lumber of this World; when God is calling me to a <hi>Glorious Crown?</hi> Art thou, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> a King's Son, an Heir of Heaven, an Expectant of ſuch great Felicity, and yet ſtoop ſo low? Hope for Heaven, and yet graſp this Earth; and hug the vain Appearances of Earthly Good? Hope to be <hi>like to God,</hi> (and Oh how Glorious an Hope is that!) to partake of his Image, and live Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with him; and yet be ſolicitous, anxious, and diſquieted about Honour, and Money, and a Temporal Intereſt? And mightily concerned about the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Gratifications of the Fleſh, and the Enjoyments of this World? Art thou a Pilgrim and Stranger here, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Home to the Heavenly Country,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35082:66"/>and yet eager and paſſionate about Earthly Things? Should an Heart that is ſet upon Heaven, (or may be ſo, and ought to be ſo) ſhould it burn with ſuch <hi>Kitchin,</hi> ſuch <hi>Common-Fire?</hi> And neglect the unconceivable Riches and Pleaſures, and immortal Honours of the <hi>other Life,</hi> and the Dawnings of that Glory upon my Soul, by the Foretaſts of it in <hi>this?</hi> How great is the Diſproportion between the Heavens and the Earth? How vaſt the Circumference of the one, and how ſmall a Point the other? How many thouſand Miles, doth the Sun travel in the Heavens, while it paſſeth but one Inch upon a Dial? Oh! that my Affections were carried to <hi>Heavenly</hi> Things, with a ſwiftneſs ſomewhat anſwerable to the Glorious Object. And let their Motion to <hi>Earthly</hi> Things, be rather ſlow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, like that of the Sun on a Dial. Since I profeſs to believe, and wait for the Heavenly Glory; ſhould I not live, as ſeeking ſuch Things, as expecting ſuch a Glory? And are careleſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thoughts, ſleepy, heartleſs Prayers, faint and weak Endeavours, becoming in ſuch a Caſe? Shall I not mend my Pace, and double my Diligence in my preparatory Work? When I can believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35082:67"/>foreſee the Bleſſed Recompence; waiting for that <hi>Everlaſting Light</hi> of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, which no Eclipſe ſhall ever darken or obſcure; for that Eternal Glorious Day, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be cloſed with an Evening. When I ſhall ſee the Face of God in Chriſt, and be like him; participate more of his Image, reſt in his Love, and dwell for ever in the Light of his Countenance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prayer and Promiſe of my Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>And ought not ſuch a Proſpect, to ſweeten the Bitterneſs of all our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Sufferings? We are now, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Heavineſs and Sorrow; but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will be enough for an uninterrupted Joy. When we ſhall exchange all our Troubles for Everlaſting Reſt, our Priſons for Perfect Liberty, our Poverty for the Riches of God; Darkneſs for Light; Diſcord for Love; Deformity for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; our Weakneſſes and preſent Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhings, for Strength and Vigor; Folly for Wiſdom; Diſgrace for Glory; Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pain for Eternal Eaſe and Health; the Animal for the Angelical Life; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and Pollution for Conſummate Holineſs; our Sighs, and Tears, and Sorrows, and Complaints, for Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant

O that <hi>Divine Love</hi> might be the ruling Principle within me! to inſpire all my Thoughts, to regulate all my Deſires, to ſet all the Powers of my Soul on Work!

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35082:74"/>
                  <hi>every Man</hi> is to be judged at the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>Tho' we cannot diſtinctly tell what, or how great our Lord's <hi>Glory</hi> will then be; we may be certain, it will be ſuitable to the Dignity of his Royal Perſon, ſuitable to the Grandeur of his Father's Majeſty; with the Splendour of a <hi>Triumphant Prince,</hi> who is <hi>Heir of all Things;</hi> and hath all Power in Heaven and in Earth committed to him; the Great Lord of both Worlds, Head of Angels and Men; and ſuitable to his Glorious Office, as Mediator, and the appointed Judge of Quick and Dead.</p>
               <p>If at his <hi>Tranfiguration</hi> his Face ſhone, and his Raiment was white and glittering; How much more Splendid will his laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be?

And if even <hi>Moſes</hi> did then exceedingly quake and fear, what will be the Conſternation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35082:74"/>and trembling of the wicked World at the Coming of Chriſt? <hi>When he ſhall be revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire,</hi> with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retinue of his mighty <hi>Angels,</hi> as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bright Stars, about the more glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs. The Lights of Heaven ſhall be eclips'd; the viſible Sun ſhall vail its bluſhing head, as infinitely out-ſhone; the preſent Glory of the Creation be all benighted, by reaſon of his tranſcendent Brightneſs.

They deſpiſed him as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> offer'd his Sacrifice to take away the Sins of the World; but ſhall no longer do ſo, when he comes as the <hi>Lion</hi> of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> to devour and deſtroy the Enemies of his Croſs. <hi>Now</hi> they will not own him for their <hi>Lord,</hi> but ſhall <hi>then</hi> find he is ſo, by the Vengeance he will execute.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as a <hi>Saviour</hi> they rejected him, making light of his Salvation, deſpiſing his Mercy, refuſing his Grace: but the <hi>neglected Goſpel,</hi> will then be a more <hi>killing Letter</hi> than the <hi>Law.</hi> He who by his Embaſſadors doth now intreat Sinners to be reconciled, will
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35082:78"/>then be as deaf to <hi>their Intreaties,</hi> as they have been to <hi>His.</hi> Becauſe they would not turn at his Reproof, hearken to the Call of his Word, and obey its Voice, they muſt hear the Sentence of Condemnation, and feel the Execution of it, whether they will or no; yea, the Blood of his <hi>Croſs</hi> will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid, accuſe, and plead againſt them. And whatſoever fooliſh Evaſions they now make, to continue in ſecurity, they ſhall then be <hi>Speechleſs,</hi> and <hi>Self-condemned.</hi> Nothing will be able to hide them, from the amazing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their <hi>Judge,</hi> or from the Wrath of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> He then will inflict an intolerable and righteous Vengeance, an <hi>Everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> upon all the ignorant and ungodly World: The Greateſt, the Stouteſt, the Boldeſt of them, ſhall then be humbled, and ſtand before Chriſt's Tribunal, upon an <hi>equal Level</hi> with the Meaneſt; ſeized with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, filled with guilt, anguiſh, and deſpair; and find to their eternal Confuſion, that <hi>the Judge is no reſpecter of Perſons, but every man ſhall receive according to his works.</hi> The Mighty ſhall not be ſpared for his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor the Mean man for his Poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Fool! O Wretch</hi> that I am! ſhall many then ſay, who now brave it out in Pride and Vanity, unconcern'd about a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! not to be perſuaded by the Terrors
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35082:79"/>of the Lord, which I was ſo often warn'd and foretold of! What Refuge of Hope can I now flie to? What can I ſay for my ſelf? What can I do to eſcape, to die, to exiſt no longer? I would have <hi>no compaſſion</hi> on my own Soul; I would not ſo much as <hi>conſider</hi> its danger; I ſhall now find <hi>none</hi> from Chriſt, I can expect none: His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is gone, and gone for ever! I am loſt, undone, tormented, and muſt eternally be ſo. O the <hi>Amazement, Horror,</hi> and <hi>Deſpair</hi> of ſelf-condemned Sinners in that day of Vengeance!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O my Soul!</hi> what is there of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, or of greater Certainty from the Word of God, than that <hi>I muſt</hi> appear to Judgment, when Chriſt ſhall come again? <hi>Lord,</hi> teach me to believe it firmly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it often, to lay it ſeriouſly to heart, to act under the Influence and Power of it, as long as I live; that at the <hi>Great Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> from the Dead, I may lift up my head with a joyful Hope, and find the <hi>Judge</hi> to be <hi>my Friend, my Advocate, my Jeſus,</hi> and not <hi>my Enemy,</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyer.</hi>

                  </q> O what raviſhing words will theſe be! What an Ecſtaſie of Love and Kindneſs is implied in them!

O Glorious Day! when my bleſſed Lord ſhall thus publickly acknowledge me for his own, and plead my Cauſe againſt all the Accuſations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and the malicious Calumnies of all his Inſtruments! when I ſhall be able to ſay of all my ſins and ſufferings, as my Lord upon the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed, it is finiſhed!</hi> My warfare being accompliſh'd, being more than Conqueror over all, through him who loved me, and died for me, and now is come to <hi>wipe away all tears from mine eyes,</hi> as it were with the <hi>Napkin</hi> that was bound about his Head, when laid in the Grave; all being the fruit of his merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Death.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35082:80"/>or by my folly, and ſcandal, diſcredit his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name and Goſpel: but by <hi>conſummate Holineſs</hi> be fitted, to rejoyce in his Preſence and Love, and celebrate his Praiſe for ever.

               <p>All the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Perfections</hi> of Chriſt, will then be <hi>glorified</hi> in Believers, and admired by them.

               <p>The Glory of <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> will then appear, when the Conſtitution, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and Deſign of the Mediator's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be fully known, in the admirable Order and Beauty of every part of it, with the exact Tendency of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

               <p>As in uniting Heaven and Earth together in the Perſon of our Moderator; fulfilling the truth of a terrible Threatning in his Death, and by the ſame way accompliſhing

               <p>But the <hi>Love and Grace of Chriſt;</hi> the infinite Goodneſs and Compaſſion of God, will then be magnified in an <hi>eſpecial</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

What unparallel'd kindneſs in the Accompliſhment of it, by the Sacrifice of the Son of God? And how Glorious will <hi>this Love</hi> appear, when he ſhall come again to give us the full Harveſt of all his Purchaſe? With what admiring Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall Believers then contemplate the unſearchable Riches of his Grace?

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35082:82"/>to its Completion; yea, from before the Foundation of the World, in the <hi>Covenant of Peace</hi> between the Father and the Son, until his ſecond Coming, to Judge the World, and deliver up the Kingdom to his Father.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we then admire, and adore his <hi>Powerful Grace,</hi> which ſnatcht us as Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands out of everlaſting Burnings; that effectually ſhin'd into our minds by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light; conquer'd the Oppoſition of our ſtubborn Wills; Sanctified our carnal Hearts, reſcued us from the Tyranny of Satan, and the Dominion of Luſt; giving, cheriſhing, and preſerving the holy Seed of <hi>Grace,</hi> and making it Spring up to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; defeating the malicious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Endeavours of the Devil to deſtroy it; inabling us to indure Tribulation, and perſevere to the end; giving us Victory over <hi>Death;</hi> conducting us through the dark Valley; raiſing our Bodies, reviving ard reuniting them to our Souls, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them glorious like his own Body; and at length rewarding our imperfect Services with <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Yea, tho' our beſt Services were mixt with Sin, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Duties ſpotted, our moſt couragious Sufferings mixt with Unbelief, yet reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Bleſſedneſs, that hath no Alloy
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35082:82"/>of Evil, but all the Ingredients of a <hi>Perfect Felicity,</hi> and nothing to leſſen and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it. How ſhall we then admire the <hi>Bounty</hi> of our Gracious Lord, the Freeneſs, Tenderneſs, Riches, and the exceeding Greatneſs, and Glory of his <hi>Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to poor Believers.</p>
               <p>With what Ecſtaſies of Joy and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, may we imagine, that our Lord will be then admired by all his Redeemed ones?</p>
               <p>Saying, <hi>This is He,</hi> who made our Peace with God, and reverſt the Sentence of Damnation, which we were under; who bought us with the price of his moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood, bore the Wrath of his Father, and ſubmitted to an infamous and curſed Death for us. He aſſumed <hi>our</hi> Nature, that we might partake of <hi>his;</hi> became the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> that we might be made the <hi>Children of God; for our ſakes he became poor, that we through his Poverty might become Rich:</hi> He ſtoopt to bear the greateſt Ignominy and Reproach, to confer Honour on us: He was <hi>for a time</hi> forſaken of his Father, that we might not be ſo <hi>Eternally:</hi> He felt the ſtroke of his Anger againſt Sin, that we might not periſh under it. He was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Griefs, that we might Rejoyce: His Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35082:83"/>and bloody Sweat were for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and by his Stripes we are Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He bowed his Head on the Croſs, that we might lift up ours in Triumph; and becauſe we had eaten of the forbidden Fruit, he hung on the Accurſed Tree. 'Twas <hi>for us</hi> that he ſuffered the Frowns of Heaven, the Enimity of Hell, the Rage of Devils, the Hatred and Perſecution of the World: He was judged, that we might not come into Condemnation: He was Crucified, that we might be Glorified; and he is now <hi>Come again,</hi> finally and fully to effect it.</p>
               <p>O the <hi>Height,</hi> and <hi>Depth,</hi> and <hi>Length,</hi> and <hi>Breadth</hi> of the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> which paſſeth Knowledge, but calls for Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and everlaſting Gratitude! This is the <hi>Bleſſed Day</hi> we long'd and waited, and prayed for! This is our <hi>Gracious,</hi> our <hi>Glorious Lord,</hi> whoſe Love melted our Heart, whoſe Promiſe was our Support, whoſe Word was our Rule, whoſe Spirit was our Comforter, whoſe Croſs was our Crown, and the Hope of his Appearance our chief Conſolation!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord!</hi> What <hi>am I,</hi> what <hi>was I,</hi> that the ever Bleſſed Son of God ſhould do and ſuffer and purchaſe all this <hi>for me?</hi> I can remember when I was ignorant of God, a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35082:83"/>Stranger to him, at Enmity with him, under the Power of Darkneſs, and the Devil, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, haſtening to Hell, and liable to his Wrath. But he choſe me out of the World, ſtampt his Image upon me, pardoned my Sins, and imbrac'd me in the Arms of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love. <hi>O happy Change!</hi> and yet how little did I prize his Grace, admire his Love, and expreſs my own, or promote his Glory, and honour him in the Eyes of others? How did I diſhonour my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and holy Calling, as his Diſciple, by aggravated Apoſtacy? But he recovered me by <hi>Repentance,</hi> and healed my <hi>Back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> and received me graciouſly, becauſe he loved me freely. <hi>O admirable Grace!</hi> to pardon, and ſave, and bring to Glory ſuch an unthankful <hi>Wretch,</hi> as I have been! to make ſuch a <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Others,</hi> whom I knew on Earth! That the ſame Power, which makes <hi>them Miſerable,</hi> now makes <hi>me Bleſſed!</hi> That when they are baniſht from his Preſence into Everlaſting Deſtruction, I am admitted to behold his Glory, and ſhall dwell with him for ever!</p>
               <p>O, how much <hi>more</hi> do I now ſee and find, than ever I believed, of the Love of Chriſt, and his promiſed Salvation! How
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35082:84"/>much <hi>more</hi> glorious is the Perſon of my Redeemer! How much <hi>more</hi> Excellent is the Heavenly State, than ever I thought or expected! I could not have imagined the <hi>thouſandth, thouſandth Part</hi> of that which I now ſee and feel. I cannot but admire, and ſpend an <hi>Eternity</hi> in admiring, and praiſing the incomparable Grace and Glory of my bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Such Holy Admiration will certainly produce the moſt <hi>thankful Adoration</hi> of our Lord Jeſus. Saying one to another, <hi>O Bleſs the Lord of Love and Glory!</hi> Who humbled himſelf ſo low, as our Mediator, and hath exalted us ſo high, as the bleſſed Fruit of it! How can we ever <hi>enough</hi> adore and praiſe him, who condeſcended ſo far, and hath done and ſuffer'd ſo much for us? See how the Holy Angels worſhip this King of Glory! And have not every one of us more reaſon to do ſo? O let all the Quire of Heaven celebrate his glorious Love! And let us his Redeemed, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ones ſay continually, <hi>Let the Lord be magnified; who hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood, and made us Kings and Prieſts unto God his Father, and through him ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O merciful Saviour! O glorious Change! <hi>O happy Society!</hi> With whom we ſhall Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35082:84"/>adore our Common Lord. We can ſome of us remember, when we lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Earth, how we wept and prayed, and faſted and mourned together, how we ſuffered, and complain'd, and ſinn'd together. O the marvellous Change our Redeemer hath now wrought for us, and in us! Theſe Bodies, theſe Souls, this Life, this Place, this Company, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, are not like thoſe in yonder World. But <hi>alas,</hi> who can deſcribe what Believers ſhall then think, and ſay to extol their Saviour! How ſmall a Portion is it we underſtand of that World? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can I conceive, and how much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs? Bleſſed be God we know ſo much, as the matter of our joyful Hopes; and for ever Bleſſed be God, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and provided ſuch a Glory for us, as cannot now be fully known.</p>
               <p>What inexpreſſible Sweetneſs might Believers taſt, by rejoycing in <hi>Hope,</hi> did a more lively <hi>Faith</hi> realize all this to their Souls? We might liſten as it were to the Shouts and Acclamations of the <hi>Saints</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. We might behold them about the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, with Pſalms of <hi>Victory</hi> in their Hands, a Crown of <hi>Glory</hi> on their Heads, and Songs of <hi>Triumph</hi> in their Mouths, ſaying, <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah;

Whoſe Image do I bear? How have I lived, and what do I do? What do I love moſt? What do I moſt conſtantly deſire, and chuſe, and ſeek? How doth the Pulſe of my Soul beat? Is it quickeſt towards</hi> God, <hi>or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> World? <hi>Whither am I going? What will be the final upſhot and iſſue of my preſent
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35082:86"/>courſe? Is it</hi> Heaven <hi>or</hi> Hell <hi>I muſt be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to by dying? What ſecurity have I got for</hi> Eternal Life? <hi>What proviſions have I made? What Foundation have I laid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſtrangely infatuated are moſt Men, who talk of an <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> as an Article of their Creed, and ſay they count upon it, that they muſt dwell in <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> for <hi>ever;</hi> and ſeldom or never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves in good earneſt, and for any time, with a ſetled compoſed exerciſe of thoughts, which of theſe <hi>Two</hi> is like to be their Lot. Or if they begin to ſearch and try themſelves, they come to no <hi>Concluſion,</hi> or conclude too haſtily; they pluck off the Plaiſter, as ſoon as it begins to ſmart; they are either frighted with the horrid proſpect of paſt Crimes, or having eſcap'd the groſſer Pollutions of the World, judge too favourably of their own caſe. They commonly do the Work but by halves, and ſo go from the Glaſs, and forget what manner of Perſons they were.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Sequeſter my ſelf from the World, to commune with my own Heart, to reflect upon my paſt Life, and look into my preſent State, to recollect and review the moſt conſiderable Paſſages of my courſe, and time hitherto. O how neglected and diſuſed a Practice is this, which doth challenge and require our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35082:87"/>and moſt ſerious Concerns about it! And how many begin it, and are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and leave off without reaching the end of ſuch an Enquiry?</p>
               <p>How much <hi>wiſer</hi> in this reſpect are the <hi>Children of this World, in their Generation,</hi> than the <hi>Children of Light?</hi> Who is ſo exact in his <hi>Accompts</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and his own <hi>Soul,</hi> as <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> in their <hi>Dealings</hi> with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? Who is at the pains to write down his <hi>Sins</hi> and his <hi>Mercies?</hi> the <hi>grounds</hi> of his <hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>Encouragements</hi> of his <hi>Hope;</hi> or keeps a <hi>Journal</hi> and <hi>Diary</hi> of his <hi>Spiritual State?</hi> Who doth at ſet times, once a <hi>Month,</hi> or once a <hi>Quarter,</hi> or even once a <hi>Year,</hi> take a juſt view of himſelf, his Heart, and Life, and State, as a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> that he may ſee what he hath received and done, what he owes, and what he may expect; that he may know whether he <hi>thrive</hi> or <hi>decay;</hi> whether he <hi>increaſe</hi> or <hi>decreaſe;</hi> whether he go <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>forward;</hi> whether he be <hi>Richer</hi> or <hi>Poorer</hi> this Year than the laſt? And is it not a <hi>Symptom</hi> that you are <hi>declining,</hi> when you love not to examine your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts? Is there not ground of <hi>jealouſie</hi> and <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> that you are <hi>behind-hand,</hi> becauſe you are loth to inquire, whether you are or no? And unwilling to know the worſt of your Condition? Nevertheleſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and bringing the matter
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35082:87"/>to a <hi>Determination,</hi> at what uncertainties muſt we live? And how unconceivable an hazard do all Hypocrites and unrenewed Sinners run? And how reaſonable, how neceſſary is it that we ſhould know, and in order to it, prove our ſelves? We muſt therefore beſtow Time, and ſerious Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence about it, that we may examine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the bottom, and come to ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; ſo that we may form a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning our own Caſe.</p>
               <p>He that would do it to good purpoſe, muſt endeavour to underſtand clearly the terms of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> on God's part, and on ours: And take care not to Judge of himſelf by miſtaken Rules; by a falſe Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard that God will not juſtifie; or by any ſuch Characters as will not conclude. But moſt Men are <hi>unwilling</hi> to bring themſelves to a <hi>Trial,</hi> or to let Conſcience deal plainly and faithfully with them. They are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly ſecure, and ſee not the neceſſity of this duty: Or do not ſuſpect themſelves. They preſume they need not be at that Trouble: Or are ſo taken up with the World, that they cannot find <hi>time</hi> and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for it. And many Men dare not bring their Hearts and Ways to a Trial. There is commonly ſome <hi>ſecret Luſt</hi> indulg'd, which they are loth to let go. But moſt go on in ſin, and periſh Eternally, becauſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35082:88"/>they think there is no danger of periſhing: and never Repent, and make their Peace with God, becauſe they fancy, and preſume 'tis done already.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me beg of thee, <hi>whoever thou art,</hi> who readeſt this, to put the Caſe to thy ſelf, ſeriouſly to admit the doubt, whether you are not miſtaken; make the <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> that you have not hitherto ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conſidered the State of your Soul. You are confident that <hi>all is well;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are unwilling to Examine farther: But for that very reaſon you ought to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether it be ſo or not? Do but ask your ſelves ſeriouſly, what is the <hi>ground</hi> of your good Opinion concerning your ſelf? For what reaſon can you thus conclude?</p>
               <p>Did you ever ſeriouſly lay to heart the <hi>Characters,</hi> and Deſcription, which the Scriptures give, of thoſe whom Chriſt will own at the laſt day; and of ſuch whom he will reject and reprobate? With un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Application to <hi>your own caſe,</hi> have you therewith prov'd your ſelves? and come to a ſetled Judgment, after a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enquiry? and was the <hi>Concluſion</hi> to your Comfort and Joy? If ſo, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence hath it ſince had upon your Heart and Life? Hath it promoted Purity, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Heavenly-mindedneſs, Contempt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35082:88"/>of this World, and ſtronger Deſires after the Image, Love, and Preſence of God, and the Glory of Chriſt? Moreover, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Is not this a good while a-go? How have you behav'd your ſelf ever ſince? Have you not reaſon to look back with ſhame? If you but <hi>ſlightly</hi> examin'd your ſelf formerly, reſolve to do it more effectually now: Review the ſins you have been ſince guilty of. And if you have not done any thing conſiderable of this kind, you ought <hi>now</hi> to begin. It is ſeaſonable to begin the year by ſuch an Exerciſe, and it will be found of great uſe, in all the following parts of it: Eſpecially when you come to examine your ſelf afreſh, in order to the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi> For we ought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to renew the ſad Remembrance of our former Sins; that from time to time we may renew our <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is the Work of our Life, and not of one day. And he that comes to the Sacrament, and will look no farther back, than to the laſt Communion, may poſſibly preſume too much, that all was then, as it ſhould be, and not be humble enough.</p>
               <p>If any one therefore reſolve in good earneſt upon an holy Life, and ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to prepare for <hi>Eternity,</hi> as it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make a general Review of his Life,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35082:89"/>ſo I deſire to afford him the beſt Counſel I can, in order to it.</p>
               <p>It may be adviſable,

How you did ordinarily carry it in your Place and Station; for that is the beſt, the trueſt Picture of a Man, which is like him in his ordinary, every days Habit.

Shew me mine Infirmities and Wickedneſs, that I may watch againſt them. And teach me to Judge and condemn my ſelf, that I may not be judged of the Lord, or condemned with the World.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>How Christians ought to examine their</hi> Decays <hi>of</hi> Grace <hi>and</hi> Piety. <hi>The greatneſs of their</hi> Sin, <hi>and of their</hi> Loſs <hi>under ſuch a Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: God</hi>'s Diſpleaſure, <hi>and departure from them, conſidered, to awaken Endeavours of a Recovery. In what manner the</hi> Faith <hi>of</hi> Adherence <hi>may be acted by one, who hath no</hi> Aſſurance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT cannot but be of uſe to <hi>Believers</hi> alſo, at ſtated Times to examine themſelves,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35082:91"/>concerning their Languiſhings and Decays in Grace, falling from their firſt Love, to a Spirit of Indifferency and Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſorderly walking or unfruitfulneſs; whether <hi>gray Hairs are not here and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they know it not.</hi> For God may withdraw by degrees, ſo that his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may not preſently be perceiv'd. And ſome kind of Activity in Duty, may be continued upon falſe Principles, and from Common Aſſiſtance, while a Chriſtian, as to his ſpiritual State, may be under a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſumption. 'Tis not difficult for others to obſerve it ſome times, and would be viſible enough to themſelves, would they ſpare a few hours to examine the matter. The Puniſhment of ſuch Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, the loſs of the quickning, and comforting Preſence of the Holy Spirit, deſerves likewiſe to be inquir'd into, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a ſpeedy Remedy, and ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Counſel.</p>
               <p>I mean not barely the Ebbing of <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> in the Duties of Religion, or the want of Life, and quickning from <hi>ſenſible Conſolations,</hi> which new Converts, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as have been reclaim'd from a courſe of notorious Impiety) have more of at firſt, than afterwards. This <hi>doubting Chriſtians</hi> ſhould particularly take notice of, by the Inſtance of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> who was
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35082:92"/>extraordinarily feaſted at his firſt Return, but was doubtleſs contented afterwards with the ordinary Proviſions of his Fathers houſe. Neither doth God diſpence the ſame meaſure to <hi>all alike,</hi> nor to <hi>any</hi> alike at <hi>all Times:</hi> Some, who are called to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Services and Sufferings, than others, or had greater Conflicts before Converſion, may have a greater ſhare than the reſt of their Brethren. Neither will the <hi>ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Grace imparted to <hi>ſome</hi> Perſons, ſo diſcernably move and comfort, as it will do ſome others of a different Temper. 'Tis not therefore ſo much to be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Enquiry, (if at all it need to be ſo) whether we have more or leſs of ſenſible Joy, in the performance of Duty. But</p>
               <p>Whether we are not fallen and declin'd, <hi>as to the inward vital Acts of Grace, and in the outward Fruits of Holineſs.</hi> Whether we have ſuch clear convincing Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Divine and Spiritual Truths, and the Myſteries of the Goſpel, as formerly; whether our minds are not become more vain and heedleſs; whether our Knowledge of God, and of the Revelations of his Will, be as powerful and efficacious upon our Hearts and Lives, as heretofore; whether there be not leſs Frequency, leſs Conſiſtency, leſs inward Satisfaction in holy ſerious
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35082:92"/>Thoughts, than formerly. You were wont to pray and endeavour, that God might be <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> in your Thoughts every day, and by frequent Ejaculations in civil affairs, to maintain a daily converſe with God; but now you mind not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or not; yea, you cannot but know, that it is not thus with you ſtill. It was once your Burden to be peſter'd with fooliſh, filthy, worldly, vain Thoughts, eſpecially on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> or in the Worſhip of God; you rejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd them, you lamented and pray'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; do ſo much as examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be thus ſtill.</p>
               <p>Conſider all your <hi>Affections,</hi> and their ſeveral Objects; and ſee whether a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Lukewarmneſs hath not diffus'd it ſelf into every of them. Examine eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Grace;</hi> and ſee whether your Faith, Hope, Love, holy Deſires, and Delight in God be not miſerably abated; as to the ſtrength and vigor, the efficacy, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſe of every of them; ſo that your Thoughts of God are few, cold, and lifeleſs, without Deſire, Delight and Love.</p>
               <p>Conſider the <hi>Opportunities of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and ſolemn Occaſions of approaching the <hi>Divine Preſence:</hi> Are they as much the deſire of your Souls, and the rejoycing of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35082:93"/>your Hearts, as once they were? Are you not more eaſily diverted from them, leſs ſatisfy'd and refreſh'd by them? Are not all Goſpel-Ordinances leſs powerful and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and your profit and advantage thereby unſpeakably leſs than formerly? Do you hunger and thirſt, and pant as the Hart after the Water-brooks, to draw nigh to God, and come into his Courts? Do you make conſcience of preparing before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand? Do you come with a real deſire, and deſign, and expectation of profiting, and bettering your Spirits? Do you join in every part of Divine Worſhip with that attention, ſeriouſneſs, and compoſure of mind, and taſte the ſweetneſs and benefit of ſuch Solemnities, as <hi>formerly?</hi> Are ſuch ſervices perform'd with that Awe of God, with that Humility, Fervency, and Intenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, as ſometimes they were? Are you not more negligent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd before and after, whether you find any thing of this, or no? Tho' your Deſires are weak, your Hearts flat, your Thoughts wandring, your Spirits trifling, ſo the work be done, and the duty be over, (in how formal, cuſtomary, and careleſs a manner, ſoever it be) you conſider it not, you lay it not to heart, you reflect not upon it, you bewail it not: Or at leaſt are better contented, and ſooner quieted, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35082:93"/>take leſs notice of the frame of your Heart in ſuch Duties, than formerly.</p>
               <p>Examine farther, how 'tis with you as to the great <hi>diſtinguiſhing Duties</hi> of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Chriſtian, (if performed as they ought to be) I mean <hi>Secret Prayer, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> Are you as ſtrict and careful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and conſcientious, frequent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in theſe, as formerly? May not our Cloſets and places of Retirement wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt us? How ſeldom are we there? How quickly are we gone? How eaſily diverted? How ſoon tired? How do we trifle in that work, and ſhuffle it over and take up with the ſhadow and image of Prayer? Our former humble and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayers, joyful Thankſgivings, and ſweet Contemplation of the Myſteries of Religion, compared with our preſent day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice, will teſtifie that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd and fallen.</p>
               <p>Moreover conſider <hi>the Evil of Sin,</hi> and how your Heart ſtands affected to it. Is not your Hatred of Sin, and Zeal againſt it much decay'd? eſpecially with reſpect to inward <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> ſuch as the ſecret workings of unbelief, and diſtruſt, pride, envy, uncharitableneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you bewail it, ſtrive againſt it, and ſhun the occaſions, and fear the temptations that may lead you into Sin, as once you did? Have you not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:35082:94"/>loſt much of that tenderneſs, and holy Jealouſie over your heart and ways you formerly had? Do you not now make more bold with Temptation? Are you not oftener conquered? And with leſs Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance? And by ſmaller Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you not more <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſerviceable?</hi> Root and Fruit in a withering condition? God leſs honour'd, and others leſs profited, and edified by your Example and Life? Do you not adhere more to the World? conform to it, and comply with it in many things, which formerly you durſt not have done? And are every day waxing worſe? Make a pauſe a while, and bethink your ſelf, what this will come to at laſt, when even the little Good that remains, is ready to die.</p>
               <p>May I not ask <hi>ſuch Chriſtians,</hi> or deſire them to ask themſelves; What is already the effect and conſequence of this Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Is not God's Spirit removed, and the Light of his Countenance Eclipſed? Yea as to many of them, are they not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſad apprehenſions of God's diſpleaſure? Do they not feel the terrors of the Lord? Do they not walk heavily from day to day? They, that could once converſe with <hi>God</hi> on all occaſions as a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>Father,</hi> do now think of God and are troubled:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35082:94"/>Thick Darkneſs doth incompaſs them round about: They have loſt the ſenſe of his Love, the comforts of his preſence, and their Song in the night, and ſee no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. This is a more hopeful Caſe however than <hi>theirs,</hi> who are under great Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Deſertion, and hardly ſenſible of it. To awaken and aſſiſt both; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I beſeech you, <hi>whence you are fallen,</hi> and what you have loſt, and what will be the Iſſue of this; if Sickneſs, or ſome ſmart Affliction overtake you; or if you ſhould die in this condition. And inquire <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> and preſently, into the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all this Evil: For a few tranſient thoughts will not affect the Heart, and perſuade to Action. And do it <hi>preſently,</hi> becauſe by every delay your work will be the harder, your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the greater, and your recovery the more difficult. Reflect upon the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> as well as <hi>Affliction</hi> of this caſe. Know that you have diſpleaſed God, and run from him, neglected his Preſence, and griev'd his Spirit, and in what Inſtances you have done ſo, that hath made him weary of his dwelling; what Ordinances you have ſlighted; what Duties you have omitted; what ſins you have given way to; in order to <hi>Repentance</hi> and deep Humiliation.</p>
               <p>Can you <hi>contentedly</hi> ſit ſtill with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal State of things? While <hi>God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:35082:95"/>(yea a great deal indeed) <hi>againſt you, for having left your firſt Love?</hi> Will you not endeavour to remove that, which hath made ſuch a Separation between God and you, and brought you thus low? What Communion with God, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of his Grace, what Influences of his Spirit, and Evidences of his Favour have you loſt? And will you not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your Iniquity, and abaſe your ſelves in the Duſt, and return to the Lord, and do your firſt Works? That he may heal your Back-ſlidings, and receive you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly; that you may again take hold of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and be at <hi>Peace</hi> with him?</p>
               <p>But to be <hi>at Peace</hi> with God, is not the whole of your Concern; you need not only a Pardon, but a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to heal you; as doth a Malefactor, that is not only liable to the Law, but deſperately ſick. Your State is <hi>ſinful,</hi> and dangerous, as well as troubleſome. From performing duties in ſuch a manner as you now do, you may quickly be Tempted to let them altogether alone. God may be ſo far provok'd, to ſuffer Satan to make attempts upon you of that kind: (and he is forward enough to make uſe of ſuch an opportunity, to try all his Snares and Stratagems againſt you:) till he prevail with you, to think hardly of

               <p>THat we may <hi>turn unto the Lord,</hi> is the end of ſearching and trying our Ways. <hi>Lord!</hi> I have been ſearching my Heart, and conſidering my Ways, but can find little or no <hi>good;</hi> neither can I diſcover <hi>all</hi> that is <hi>evil</hi> in both. But I find enough to make my own Heart condemn me, and Thou, <hi>(who art greater than my Heart, and knoweſt all things,)</hi> maiſt much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me.

               <p>If I go about to enumerate the Sins of my Thoughts, Words and Actions, in all the periods of my Life hitherto; if I conſider my Omiſſions of Duty, and dayly Crimes by actual Commiſſion; If I reflect upon my Sins according to their reſpective Objects, as either againſt <hi>Thee,</hi> O God, and againſt my <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and againſt <hi>my own Soul or Body;</hi> and compare my Heart and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35082:98"/>Life with thy ſtrict and holy <hi>Law,</hi> and think in how many Inſtances I have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt <hi>every</hi> of thy Righteous Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I find they are more than the hairs on my Head, they cannot be number'd. <hi>Who can tell how oft he hath offended?</hi> Many of my ſins make little Impreſſion on my <hi>Memory,</hi> (I obſerve them not, I remember them not): But this hinders not, but they may make deep Impreſſion on my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which will one day be awake, and ſet them in order before me; and they are all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>thy Book</hi> of Remembrance, in order to my final Judgment. <hi>All my ſins are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee:</hi> But thou requireſt my humble <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of them, in order to Repentance; and as a part thereof, that I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their hainous Aggravations to ſhame, and humble my ſelf the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, whom I have offended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd.</p>
               <p>How long did I ſerve divers Luſts and Pleaſures, with the neglect and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God? How ſad a Proſpect may I take of the far <hi>greateſt</hi> part of my Life paſt? Eſpecially of my <hi>younger years,</hi> which have been trifl'd away in vanity and folly? And ſince I have known the way of Truth, how ſhamefully have I prevaricated with God? I am confounded to conſider, how often I have deſpiſed the Commandment,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:35082:98"/>and rebelled againſt the Light; againſt the Principles of Education, and the checks of Conſcience, frequent Warnings from God, and Reproofs from Others; contrary to my Profeſſion, and Experience, contrary to the Obligation of peculiar Mercies, ſolemn Promiſes, Reſolutions, and Engagements, and a nearer Relation to God than many others; Which ſins have <hi>more</hi> diſhonour'd the Lord, diſcredited his Holy Goſpel, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd the Devil, ſcandaliz'd the World, and ſtrengthen'd the hands of the ungodly, than the ſins of others. And <hi>alas!</hi> How much of my precious Time is <hi>thus</hi> gone, which if duly improv'd, would <hi>now</hi> afford me comfort to review.</p>
               <p>How much Guilt have I contracted <hi>every Year,</hi> particularly in <hi>this</hi> laſt? I now begin <hi>another,</hi> which will ſoon be gone, as that which was concluded Yeſterday. And ſhall I only advance in Age, to increaſe the number of my ſins, and heighten my Account againſt the Day of Reckoning? In Temporal and Civil Affairs, <hi>Day unto Day uttereth knowledge, and Night unto Night teacheth Wiſdom.</hi> We are taught by <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> many uſeful Leſſons, which we ſhould not elſe have learnt; to reform many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and miſtakes, to correct many raſh and fooliſh Actions, and Speeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſhall I not learn Wiſdom by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:35082:99"/>of another Year, in what concerns my greateſt, my Eternal Intereſt? Shall not the reflection on my paſt ſins, prevent my Commiſſion of the like? Eſpecially conſidering how my ſins are aggravated, by every <hi>Mercy</hi> I have received; by every <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi> I have undergone; every awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Sermon</hi> I have heard; every motion of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit,</hi> and every check of my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> that I have reſiſted; every offer of his <hi>Grace;</hi> every warning of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> every invitation and call of his <hi>Word;</hi> every <hi>purpoſe</hi> to Repent, and every <hi>reſolution</hi> I have made to forſake ſin: The greater <hi>knowledge</hi> I have had of my danger, the longer time I have <hi>deliberated</hi> about it; the oftner I have <hi>confeſs'd</hi> my ſin, and been ſorry for it; every <hi>reproof</hi> I have had from others, and every <hi>promiſe</hi> I have made my ſelf, doth aggravate, and encreaſe my Guilt.</p>
               <p>How many Years hath God vouchſafed me to work out my Salvation? But how little have I done towards it? Had I died this laſt Year, how unprepar'd muſt I have made my Appearance before his Tribunal? What opportunities of doing, and receiving good have I let ſlip? Have I not made it more my buſineſs to <hi>ſeem</hi> Religious, than really to <hi>be</hi> ſo? How much of the Patience of God have I abus'd? Refuſing his Calls
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:35082:99"/>to Repentance, reſiſting the ſtrivings of his Spirit, ſmothering my Convictions, and turning the Grace of God into wantonneſs? Inſtead of returning Gratitude for all his Love, I have repeated my Tranſgreſſions after Forgiveneſs; and gone in <hi>a circle</hi> of Repenting and Sinning, even to this day. <hi>Lord,</hi> I am aſham'd, and lay my ſelf in the duſt before thee. To me belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion of Face. If God ſhould condemn and puniſh me as a Rebel, and a Traytor, and give me the Portion of Hypocrites, I cannot but own his <hi>Juſtices;</hi> even in Hell I muſt do it, with my flaming Tongue and Breath.</p>
               <p>O ſpare me, for thy Mercy's ſake! <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified; if Thou lay Judgment to the Line, and Equity to the Plummet.</hi> Give me <hi>Repentance unto life, never to be repented of,</hi> never to be retracted again. Bring me to the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which cleanſeth from <hi>all ſin.</hi> Behold the ſighings of a contrite Spirit: For <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Tranſgreſſions unto thee, againſt whom I have ſinned: O Lord, forgive the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> I am unworthy to lift up my Hands and Eyes towards Heaven, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy Son, or thy Servant: I am vile in mine own eyes, becauſe I have made my ſelf vile in Thine. For this I
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35082:100"/>am troubled, and mourn, and my Soul is grieved within me.</p>
               <p>O thou <hi>Heavenly Phyſician</hi> of Souls! from thy <hi>Pity</hi> alone I expect my cure. I am miſerable and undone without thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and expect no relief but from the Treaſure of thy Grace. I muſt periſh, and ſink under the burden of Sin, if thy merciful hand do not ſave me, and lift me up. I am intangl'd and inſnar'd by the Devil and my Luſts, and without thy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour can never hope to get free. <hi>O Lord, forgive my Sin, and heal my Soul: Deliver and ſave me, for thy Mercies ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May I not yet <hi>hope in thy Mercy?</hi> Thou haſt mercifully born with me hitherto: Thou calleſt me to repent; thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt me to return, and promiſeſt to forgive thoſe Sins, which are confeſſed and forſaken: O do not caſt me out of thy Sight and Preſence, now I deſire, from the bottom of my Heart, to return to thee! <hi>I abhor my ſelf, in dust and aſhes,</hi> for my paſt Iniquities. But <hi>alas!</hi> ſuch is the hardneſs of my Impenitent Heart, that I am even aſham'd of my humbleſt Repentance: how much more may God deſpiſe and reject it? But haſt thou not given thy Bleſſed Son to die for Sinners? and exalted him to this very end, to be <hi>a Prince, and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins?</hi> And
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35082:100"/>by the word of thy Grace, thou beſeecheſt all (even the greateſt Sinners) to accept of mercy; and art <hi>more willing</hi> to Pardon, than we can be to Repent. 'Tis thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Glory, agreeable to thy Nature, and declared Name, <hi>as a God gracious, and merciful, ſlow to Anger; and of great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin.</hi> O Pardon mine <hi>Iniquity,</hi> for it is <hi>great;</hi> and receive <hi>an humble Penitent,</hi> who implores thy Grace, according to the Tenor of thy <hi>new Covenant,</hi> flying to the Arms of thy Mercy, through the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Christ, who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord, hear my <hi>Prayer,</hi> and let not the mixture of my weakneſſes and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs turn it into Sin: but graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look upon <hi>a Returning Prodigal;</hi> and cauſe me to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that my ſorrowful Heart may be comforted, and my life be directed to thy Praiſe. Lead me into the path of life, that I may no longer err from the way of thy Commandments: Teach me to do thy Will, O God, and write thy Law upon my Heart, that I may never more <hi>return to Folly.</hi> I am convinc'd of the Evil of Sin, of thy Right to govern me, of the Equity and Juſtice of thy Law, of the Sweetneſs and Rewards of keeping thy Precepts: O
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35082:101"/>ſanctifie my Heart, and make me <hi>Sound in thy Statutes,</hi> that I may hate every falſe way, and be devoted to thy Fear, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Life.</p>
               <p>If there be any <hi>particular Lust,</hi> or Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which through the power of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the deceitfulneſs of Sin, you have fallen into; that hath waſted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and robb'd you of your Peace, and provok'd God to write <hi>bitter things</hi> againſt you; be ſure to humble your ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, in an eſpecial manner, for <hi>that</hi> Back-ſliding: Confeſs it freely, with its Aggravations. Conſider whether it was not after ſome ſpecial manifeſtation of God's Love, after ſome ſpecial Warning, ſome ſtrong Conviction, under or ſoon after ſome great Affliction from God, or ſome more than ordinary Kindneſs of his Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And impreſs ſuch Thoughts, to humble your ſelf the lower, ſearch into the grounds and cauſes of ſuch Apoſtacy, ſuch as the abatement of your Watchfulneſs, the neglect of ſerious cloſet-Devotion, making bold with Temptation, too great compliance with vain Company, venturing too far in lawful or indifferent Things, too much Confidence in your own Wiſdom, Strength, and Stedfaſtneſs, not fearing ſufficiently the Approaches and Beginnings of Sin, or avoiding the fuel,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35082:101"/>incentives, and occaſions of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate and diſguiſe nothing, that may make your Sin exceeding ſinful, <hi>leſt</hi> by ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Art of the Devil, you deceive your ſelf, by an half-Repentance; and the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> you think to be caſt out, return again with <hi>ſeven</hi> worſe than himſelf, and ſo your latter end be worſe than your Beginning. For if the Sin be not truly hated, but only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over with penitential Aſhes, it will quickly flame out again, when it meets with combuſtible Matter, and a ſtrong blaſt of Temptation.</p>
               <p>But if you are griev'd to the very Heart, and abhorr the Sin, and reſolve to quit it, you need not doubt of God's readineſs to receive you to Mercy. His Spirit is yet ſtriving with you, if you are willing to Repent, and return to God. He ſought you, and call'd you to return, when you were wandring as a loſt ſheep in the broad way: And can you think he will not be found of you, if you ſeek him with your whole Heart? Therefore <hi>renew</hi> your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and beg more earneſtly a Spirit of Humility, Holy Fear, and Watchfulneſs: And every Morning implore Divine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours againſt that Sin, and all <hi>Temptations</hi> to it, (<hi>which,</hi> as much as poſſible, you muſt avoid.) Conſtant and fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> after Repentance, muſt be your Refuge, and your
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35082:102"/>Remedy. If you let fall your Hands, this <hi>Amaleck</hi> will prevail again. As ſoon and as far as you fail in the Conſtancy, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of that <hi>Duty,</hi> your Sin will get ſtrength, and ſucceſsfully attempt you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. But by this Practice, God may turn Evil to work for Good, make you gain by your Loſs, ſtand the faſter by your Falls, and become ſtronger by the diſcovery of your Weakneſs, and ſo be better eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd for the future.</p>
               <p>But take heed that you pervert not the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, and encourage your ſelf to ſin again by the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> that if you ſhould <hi>Fall,</hi> 'tis but to <hi>Repent,</hi> and renew your <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and all will be well. This is a ſubtile Artifice of Satan, but ſuch, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, as ſhould take with none, who have ever known by <hi>Experience,</hi> what it is to <hi>Repent.</hi> Who have felt the burden of Sin to be heavier than <hi>a Milſtone;</hi> than the weight of <hi>a Mountain.</hi> Who have taſted, <hi>how evil and bitter a thing it is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God.</hi> Who have loathed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd themſelves, with deep Remorſe, and Sorrow, and Anguiſh of Spirit: wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all their Hearts, that they had not ſinn'd; and if it were in their power, would give all the World to retrieve it; and would rather die, than commit that Folly

How many, like him, have roar'd, and cry'd out under the ſenſe of Sin, of ſtings and furies in their Conſcience, of the poiſon'd Arrows in their Souls, and his Terrors ſurrounding them where-ever they went; from the ſenſe of his Sins Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the apprehenſions of God's Anger, and the conſequent Fears of his Wrath. <hi>Serious Repentance</hi> after great Tranſgreſſions, is <hi>another Thing</hi> than moſt imagine it. When their aggravated Sins ſhall beſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and before, be placed in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and ſet in array againſt them. 'Tis always a work of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> as well as Importance, to crucifie corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to tear a beloved Luſt from the Heart, with ſelf-indignation to abhorr and caſt away what before you lov'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in. How did <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Sin</hi> ſtare him in the Face? <hi>It is continually with me, it is ever before me,</hi> ſaid He. It haunted him like a Spectre, or like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the Wall, it ſtill appear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in ſome horrid ſhape.</p>
               <p>However <hi>Sin</hi> may ſmile in its firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and beſpeak us in flattering lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and promiſe Pleaſure, and Profit,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35082:103"/>and great Advantages and Satisfaction; theſe are but fair Appearances; This is but the <hi>outſide</hi> of the Cup, and the Colour of the Liquor: It will prove Gail and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and a mixture of deadly Poiſon, if ever God ſet it home upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and awaken us to a true ſenſe of it. And the Continuance of <hi>daily Repentance</hi> for Sin, which all Chriſtians are called to, is no ſuch eaſie matter neither. Conſtant Self-abaſement, and Humiliation before God, from a ſenſe of his Majeſty and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of our many Sins, and Pollution thereby: The imperfection of our beſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties continually to be bewailed; inordinate Affections to be ſtill mortified; always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and oppoſing Sin, in its Root and Branches; conflicting againſt the whole Intereſt of the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil; ſeeking after more Holineſs, to be deriv'd unto us by the Grace of Chriſt, to be wrought in us by his Spirit, and maintain'd by his Power; and making daily Applications to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all Grace, for ſpiritual ſtrength, to continue our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare againſt Sin, in all Inſtances of outward Duty, and inward Actings of Grace, even as long as we live; all this is included in it. Due Apprehenſions concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> (as ſo comprehenſive and difficult a Duty,) would teach us to beware of <hi>Sin.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving acknowledg'd my Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto God, and begg'd Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and experimentally learn'd <hi>the Evil of Sin,</hi> by the bitterneſs of Repentance, <hi>I reſolve,</hi> for the future, to watch againſt it more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and againſt every thing that leads to it; endeavouring to pleaſe and honour my God and Saviour, by an upright, obedient Heart and Life. And for the Remiſſion of my former contracted Guilt, I truſt to <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> according to the Revelation made in the Goſpel, of what he is, hath done, and ſuffer'd, and continues to do in Heaven, for the Salvation of Repenting Sinners, who deſire to come unto God by Him.</p>
               <p>But how often, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> have I mock'd God, and deceiv'd my ſelf, with formal and faint Purpoſes of Amendment? My good Reſolutions have been all of them <hi>as the morning Cloud, and the early Dew, which quickly paſſed away.</hi> One freſh aſſault of Temptation hath ſwept away all my good
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35082:104"/>Purpoſes as a Spider's Web. I have falſified ſo many, and broke my word ſo often, that I dare not truſt to any thing I now reſolve, or rely on any Promiſe I ſhould farther make. Succour me therefore, <hi>O Lord,</hi> by thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Grace, that what was defective in my former fruitleſs Reſolutions, may be now rectified. Let me be more humble in the ſenſe of my Weakneſs, more dependant on thy Grace, and more heartily ſeek it from time to time. <hi>Strengthen me with Strength in my Soul, with Might and Power in my inward man,</hi> that I may ſo <hi>reſolve</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> as to <hi>perform;</hi> that I may not be one day <hi>hot,</hi> and the next <hi>cold;</hi> zealous in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> but faint and lukewarm in the <hi>Brogreſs;</hi> fervent and ſerious only in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving,</hi> but weak and impotent in the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>

               <p>Having chang'd my <hi>Maſter,</hi> my <hi>End,</hi> and my <hi>Hopes,</hi> by returning unto God, from whom I had gone aſtray, I firmly <hi>reſolve,</hi> through the aſſiſtance of his Grace, to change my Courſe of Life; that Old things being done away, all things may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come New; that

                  <hi>being made free from ſin,</hi> by pardoning Mercy, <hi>and become the ſervant of Chriſt, I may have my fruit unto Holineſs, that my End may be Eternal Life.</hi> In the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,

And to that purpoſe, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Let me ſeek for continual ſupplies of Grace from Chriſt my Head, to enable me to yield ready Obedience, in the moſt difficult, hazardous, painful, and humbling Duties. In vain do I reſolve it, without the aſſiſtance of his mighty Power, to ſtrengthen my Heart and Hands, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am called to ſuch a trial of my Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Without it I ſhall never recover my Liberty, or break aſunder thoſe Bonds and Cords wherewith I have formerly been held Captive, as the Servant of Sin and Satan. Such is the Weakneſs and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my own Heart, the influence of ill Examples, and the ſubtlety and cunning of the Tempter, that otherwiſe I ſhall quickly change my mind, and <hi>return to Folly, as the Dog to his Vomit.</hi> The Spirit is ſo weak, and the Fleſh ſo frail; the Snares of the World ſo many, the Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Corruption ſo ſtrong; and of my ſelf I am ſo unſetled and wavering, ſickle and unſteady, and prone to back-ſliding, that all my ſtrongeſt purpoſes will not be ſufficient, without daily ſtrength from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. My Senſes are ſo deceitful; my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo ungovernable? the Rule and Law I am to walk by, ſo ſtrict, and ſpiritual,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35082:105"/>and extenſive: Criminal Omiſſions may be ſo frequent, and ſo eaſily overlook'd; ſo many ſeveral and difficult Duties are to be performed; and by every change of my Condition, or of God's Providence, ſo many new Dangers and new Duties may ariſe, that I fear the iſſue of my firmeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. So ſtrict a Watch muſt always be kept; ſuch Humility and Caution is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be practis'd; ſuch ſpeedy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance requir'd after every fall; with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and contentment in every State, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Calamities, (be they never ſo many, or never ſo pinching;) and perſeverance herein abſolutely neceſſary, though never ſo many Stratagems be uſed to diſcourage me from proceeding, or to entice me to go back, or turn aſide to ſome other Path; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if God had not promiſed me his continued Preſence, and that his <hi>Grace ſhall be ſufficient for me,</hi> and <hi>that I ſhall not be tempted above what I am able to bear;</hi> I ſhould utterly <hi>deſpair</hi> of making <hi>good</hi> what I now <hi>reſolve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> to encourage my Reſolved Obedience, he hath left upon Record in his Word many glorious <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> of his aſſiſting and rewarding the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution of his Servants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithful; as in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and his <hi>Three Friends,</hi> &amp;c. If Chriſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35082:105"/>ſtand by, and ſtrengthen me, I know <hi>I ſhall be able to do all things;</hi> I ſhall not <hi>then</hi> be flatter'd, or frighted out of the way of my Duty; no Wind that can blow ſhall <hi>then</hi> turn me to another Point; nothing ſhall <hi>then</hi> be able to prevail for my conſent to a wilful and deliberate forſaking of God; no Argument, no Temptation, though Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, Opportunity, Impunity from Men, with Rewards of Wordly Gain and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhould all concur to enforce a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. But, by that Heavenly Aſſiſtance, I ſhall be preſerv'd Humble, Temperate, Chaſt, Patient, Thankful, Self-denying, Crucified to the World, and <hi>hold faſt my Integrity till I die;</hi> ſtill <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> waxing ſtronger from day to day, be ſeldomer ſurpriz'd, offend leſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent more quickly, and watch more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly afterwards, till at laſt I receive the Crown.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, let me watch againſt my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> Sins, ſuch as I am moſt inclin'd to, and where a Temptation doth moſt eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; where the Devil can take the faſteſt hold, and be leaſt ſuſpected; where he hath <hi>formerly</hi> ſprung a Mine, and made a Breach: I have known ſome humble watchful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after being recovered from their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35082:106"/>Back-ſlidings, who abhorr'd every Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to <hi>that ſin,</hi> by which they had been defiled and wounded: They can hardly put up a Prayer, but they mention it; hardly have their hearts affected in any Ordinance, but they are inwardly aſham'd of it; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear of any one guilty of the like, but they are ready to burſt out into Tears.</p>
               <p>Fix therefore, I beſeech thee, <hi>moſt Gracious God!</hi> My unfeigned <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of cleaving to thee, <hi>with full purpoſe of Heart:</hi> And ſhew thy ſtrength in my weakneſs, by inabling me to <hi>do</hi> what I now <hi>reſolve.</hi> To that end, teach me to watch over <hi>my Heart,</hi> to keep it with all diligence, to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with my own Thoughts, examining the motions that ariſe in my Heart, whence they come, and whither they go, and what they tend to, that I may ſuppreſs the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi> of Sin. The unſearchable <hi>Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of the Heart, the rovings, ſtraglings and wandrings of the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable motions and ſtirrings of the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and Affections, with the <hi>corrupt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> that are ready to comply with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, make ſuch a conſtant Watchfulneſs neceſſary. Let me live no longer as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my ſelf, but by <hi>Self-Reflection</hi> dwell more at home, reckoning my principal Work to be within-doors, to keep my own Vineyard. Teach me to watch over my
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35082:106"/>
                  <hi>Senſes,</hi> to guard the door of my <hi>Lips,</hi> to govern my <hi>Paſſions;</hi> to be wary in the <hi>Choice</hi> of my Company, and in the Right <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of it; to be Circumſpect in every ſtep of my daily walk, to call my ſelf frequently to a Reckoning, to caſt up my Accounts at the foot of every Page (by <hi>every days</hi> review of my Actions,) to live always as in God's Preſence, and be awed every where by the thought of his <hi>Holy Eye,</hi> to ſhun the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appearances of Evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the neglect of this, Spiritual Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers will inſenſibly creep upon us. There is ſuch a venom and malignity in Sin, to wound and weaken the Soul, to put us off the Hinges, to diſorder and unfit us for any Spiritual Service, to make our Hearts vain and frothy, lazy and liſtleſs, that we ſhall eaſily let ſlip our Opportunities, loſe our Seaſons, and languiſh and pine away, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the means of thriving and growth. And hence it is that ſo many Profeſſors mourn and complain, lick the duſt, and lie among the Clods, are dead under the moſt awakening Miniſtry, and barren under the moſt fruitful means. Hence it is they do little Good, as well as taſte little Comfort; ſome Duties are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and others perform'd ſlightly; and in none of them do they meet with that Sweetneſs and Satisfaction, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:35082:107"/>and Advantage, Fruit and Benefit, as formerly. And all from the neglect of <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> making bold with Temptation, and not ſtanding upon their Guard in the uſe of their Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>And becauſe no Place, no Condition, no Imployment is exempted from <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> let me fortify my ſelf every morning againſt all Aſſaults for that day, by Serious Prayer, as Holy <hi>David</hi> was wont to do. <hi>My voice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up,</hi> Pſal. 5. v. 3, 4. Let the Law of God be my daily and delightful ſtudy: that I may be able pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to bring my Words and Actions to the Touchſtone; and know how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> on all occaſions, <hi>againſt the fiery Darts of the Devil:</hi> That knowing the Rule, I may not be doubtful, or at a loſs; whenever I am tempted, I may not make a ſtand to <hi>parley,</hi> but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſummon all my forces to reſiſt, and reject the Snare; being aſſur'd from God, that the Continuance of this Warfare ſhall end in a moſt Glorious Victory. <hi>He will ſhortly tread down Satan under my feet. Thanks be to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, my Lord.</hi>

               <p>Should I undertake any new Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or enter into any new Condition, or change the place of my Abode, where I might ſee more of God's diſhonour, and

               <p>This is the Method I have been often advis'd to, for <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> under doubts and ſcruples concerning my ſpiritual ſtate; to put the matter out of doubt, by <hi>again</hi> accepting the offered Mercy and Grace of the Goſpel; and heartily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the New Covenant: giving up my ſelf to God in Chriſt, to be ruled and ſaved by him.

               </p>
               <p>Do I <hi>reſolve</hi> to abide by my Choice, and to truſt in Chriſt for Perſevering Grace? And ſhall I not, <hi>ought I not</hi> to take <hi>Comfort</hi> in it?

               <p>Oh, that his Power may reſt upon me! and his Grace work in me, both to will, and to do! <hi>that this God may be my God for ever, and my Guide unto Death.</hi> Let me never re-aſſume this Gift, and Surrender of my ſelf, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud God of his Right and Propriety. <hi>His I am, and him I will ſerve:</hi> living wholly to Him; uſing all I have for him: being willing he ſhould <hi>do what he liſt with his own,</hi> and conſequently diſpoſe of me, and of all that any way belongs to me, <hi>as ſhall ſeem good in his eyes.</hi> I am <hi>Thine;</hi> O Lord, ſave me.

               <p>Let me add, for a <hi>Concluſion,</hi> That the particular Deliverances, Supports, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, which at any time God hath given in Caſes of great Exigence, or in anſwer to importunate Prayer, ought never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Many experienc'd Chriſtians have been wont to write down ſuch remarkable Appearances of God for them, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances, that did recommend, and enhance the Mercy, (whether Spiritual or Temporal) as an Encouragement to truſt in God in future Difficulties. And have afterwards found the Comfort and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, of being able to have recourſe to ſuch Papers. This Practice I recommend, as what hath been uſeful and conſolatory to divers Chriſtians, for many years afterwards; and to ſome others, of their more intimate Friends, to whom they might, without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, be imparted. What <hi>Experiences</hi> might be recorded, of ſignal Returns to Prayer, and ſeaſonable Manifeſtations of the Truth, and Goodneſs, and Wiſdom of God, if all the <hi>Inſtances</hi> thereof were duly recollected and preſerv'd! And how ſweet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant would the Work of Prayer and Praiſe then be! With what rejoycing, and delight ſhould we ſet about it, and live in it, if the conſtraining Goodneſs and Love of God, and a thankful Senſe of his unſpeakable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, did bring us to him, and indict and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:35082:123"/>every word! What Support, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and <hi>probable</hi> Hopes <hi>(at leaſt)</hi> of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love of God, might we derive, from the various Paſſages of his Compaſſion and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! And hereby we may be able, more heartily to give him Thanks, for <hi>Pardon, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> and <hi>Adoption,</hi> which we commonly mention with too much doubt and fear.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be Adviſable, To examine, and record the Workings of <hi>your own</hi> Spirit, under ſuch Diſpenſations: What Thoughts you then had of God? What Acts of Faith, Love, and Thankfulneſs, you did then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt? What Evidences of God's Favour, and what diſcovery of your own Sincerity, you have had at ſuch times? When, and how, and by what means you were cur'd of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Unbelief, and rais'd from your Deſpondency? What Promiſes you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, for relief? What Conſiderations were moſt helpful to you? What frame of Spirit you kept up in Prayer, before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? What Reſolutions and Engagements you made to God; to love, and truſt, and praiſe, and ſerve him, and give up All to his diſpoſe for the future? And what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Obligation may be inferr'd from thence, to acquieſce in the Will of God, and reſign our ſelves entirely to Him, ſaying, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever, and He will be our Guide unto Death.</hi>

               </note>, is ſuppoſed to have been in Remembrance of that Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> The Sounding of Trumpets being a token of Liberty. This <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> on the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>New Year,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Civil Account, is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,

Some think it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Memorial of Trumpets,</hi> to preſerve the Memory of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s <hi>Deliverance,</hi> by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a <hi>Ram</hi> to be ſacrificed in his ſtead: To this purpoſe it may be alledged, that it is ſometimes called by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Binding of Iſaac;</hi> which they ſuppoſe to have been in the ſame Day of the Year. By others termed <hi>Feſtum Cornu,</hi> the Feaſt of the Horn.</p>
            <p>But it is more probable, that this Name was not given, with any reſpect to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but on the account of that <hi>kind of Trumpets,</hi> which were then ſounded, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were made of Sheep or <hi>Rams Horns</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Whether the <hi>Year of Jubilee</hi> was proclaim'd by ſuch Trumpets, ſee Bp. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Commentary upon <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.10.</note>. Others think it to have been appointed as a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remembrance of former <hi>Victories</hi> which God had afforded them; particularly <hi>that</hi> at <hi>Jericho,</hi> where was the firſt oppoſition they met with in their paſſage to <hi>Canaan:</hi> And the Walls of the City fell down, at the Sound of ſuch Horn-Trumpets, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.13, 20.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35082:126"/>Beginning of the World, and to excite their Thankfulneſs for the Fruits, and Bleſſings, and Benefits of the Year preceding. The extraordinary Blowing of Trumpets by the Prieſts, at that time, (in all their Cities, as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where two

                  <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s <hi>Temple-Service,</hi> chap. 16. §. 5.</note> Silver Trumpets were alſo uſed at the Temple, as well as theſe of Horn, and the <hi>Levites</hi> ſung the 81ſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi>) might ſerve, both to ſtir up the People, to bleſs God for the Favours of the Year paſt, acknowledging his Goodneſs in preſerving them to the beginning of Another; and withal excite them to pray, for his Protection and Bleſſing, for the <hi>New-Year,</hi> on which they now entred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the famous Jewiſh Rabbin, thinks the Sounding of Trumpets at this time, was deſign'd to ſignifie ſome ſuch Exhortation as this;
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Canones de Poenitent.</hi> cap. 3. can. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ariſe, O ye ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, out of your ſleep; and you that ſlumber, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of your ſlumbering. Search your works, and turn by Repentance. Remember your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, you that have forgotten the Truth, and have exchanged it for the Vanities of the World; and have all your Lives wandred after Vanity, which will not profit, or deliver you. Conſider your Souls, Conſider your Ways, and Works; and let every one of you forſake his evil way, and his thoughts that are not good.</hi>

            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35082:126"/>
            <p>Some have imagined a Typical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the <hi>two Covenants</hi> in this Feaſt. The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> figured by the Year paſſed; and the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or the Goſpel ſtate, by the New Year then begun; and that by the <hi>Sound of Trumpets,</hi> was prefigured the future Preaching of the Goſpel, according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Their ſound went forth unto all the Earth, and their words unto the end of the World.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets</hi> is abrogated by the Preaching of the Goſpel, if that were typically ſignified by it. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel, is the <hi>joyful ſound,</hi> Pſal. 89.15. And Miniſters are to lift up their Voice like a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> Iſai. 58.1. the diſcharge of their Office, as Watchmen, is expreſs'd by <hi>ſetting the Trumpet to their mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 8.1. Ezek. 33. When the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted to the Faith of Chriſt, it is ſaid, <hi>in that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown, and they ſhall come, who are ready to periſh,</hi> Iſa. 27. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Twas the Office of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to ſound theſe Trumpets, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. The publick Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſet a-part for that Work, as the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> for theirs. We read but of <hi>two</hi> Trumpets at firſt, for <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 3.4. But <hi>David</hi> added many Muſical Inſtruments: And in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35082:127"/>time, at the Dedication of the Temple, we read of One hundred and twenty Prieſts, who ſounded with Trumpets, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. Without ſuppoſing any Type here, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe; we may yet farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Parallel, and obſerve, how the Joy and Gratitude theſe Trumpets did excite, is exceeded by that greater Rejoycing, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and foretold by the Prophets, when the glad Tidings of the Goſpel of Salvation by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſhould be publiſh'd to the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27. Which hath been in <hi>part</hi> accompliſh'd; and will be more compleat, in that Kingdom of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> which Chriſt will eſtabliſh upon Earth, toward the end of the World: And ſhall be finally perfected at the end of Time; when Days, and Years, and Time (thus mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured) ſhall be no more. When the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> having finiſhed his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Undertaking, as to what concerns <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhall come again from <hi>Heaven,</hi> with <hi>the Trump of God,</hi> to raiſe the <hi>Dead,</hi> and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all the World to their final Judgment. Then <hi>ſhall he deliver up the Kingdom to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And the Faithful ſhall enter into <hi>the Joy of their Lord,</hi> and be <hi>forever</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>There is a Tradition among the Jews, mention'd by <hi>Maimonides</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Canones de Poenit.</hi> cap. 3. can. 5.</note>, That on the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35082:127"/>
               <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>New Year,</hi> God enters into <hi>Judgment</hi> for the Sins of the <hi>Year, and Life paſt.</hi> That every one's Faults are weighed againſt his good Works.

            <p>And 'tis a general Cuſtom that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the ten firſt Days of the <hi>New Year,</hi> to riſe out of their Beds in the Night, and to continue in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> praying and worſhipping until break of Day.

However vain and groundleſs, ſuperſtitious, and abſurd many of their Cuſtoms, and Practices are, on this Day: Yet this blind <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> may juſtly ſhame, and condemn the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of our Age: Who commonly ſpend the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of every Year, worſe than any other parts of them; and inſtead of any ſolemn Retirement, for Prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might aſſiſt them to <hi>number their Days,</hi> and prepare for <hi>Eternity;</hi> (inſtead, I ſay, of ſuch ſeaſonable Exerciſes) how do vain and hurtful Sports and Paſtimes, or trifling and unedifying Mirth, and fruitleſs Converſations, conſume the greateſt part of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35082:128"/>the Days, (and <hi>Nights</hi> too) of the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year!</hi> And thus when the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the Year are offer'd up to Sin and Vanity: 'tis no wonder, if the following parts of it are employ'd to no better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; without any due concern for the Soul, and an Everlaſting State.</p>
            <p>To endeavour ſome <hi>Remedy</hi> to theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and give ſome <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> to ſuch as deſire ſeriouſly to make Religion their Principal Buſineſs, is the end of publiſhing the foregoing <hi>Reflections.</hi> I moſt heartily beſeech the <hi>God</hi> of all Grace, to influence by his Holy Spirit, the Conſcience of every Reader, that ſome ſuch good Effect may be attained.

It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly be improper, to <hi>Begin</hi> the <hi>Year</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> with <hi>whom</hi> we ſhould begin <hi>every Day.</hi> 'Tis decorous and becoming, to <hi>Dedicate</hi> our ſelves to Him, in a more ſolemn manner than ordinary, at <hi>ſuch a Time:</hi> Thankfully to acknowledge the <hi>Favours</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we have particularly received, the <hi>Year Paſt:</hi> And to recollect

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35082:129"/>and <hi>Friends, Families</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> (and our <hi>Enemies</hi> too;) and plead with God on the behalf of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the afflicted and deformed ſtate of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches.</hi> To ſome of theſe, and the like Purpoſes, I hope what is here offered, may be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient; if conſidered with <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> after humble Invocation of the <hi>Bleſſing of God,</hi> and the Aids of his Spirit; compoſing our Minds and Thoughts, as in his moſt Awful, and Holy Preſence.</p>
            <p>I have only this to requeſt; That if Any Reader ſhall find any real <hi>Benefit</hi> in this kind, he would ſo far requite my charitable <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> of him; that when his Heart is moſt ſerious, his Spirit moſt compoſed and devout, and his Affections moſt vigorous and lively, he would not forget, to put up one Prayer to Heaven for me, for Greater Holineſs, and Abilities to Honour God, and perſevering Faithfulneſs to his Truth, and Intereſt, whatever Temptations to deſert it, may be employed by the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> the <hi>three Great Enemies</hi> of thine, and my Salvation.</p>
